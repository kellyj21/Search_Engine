Should I just give up?","summary":"We met 13 years ago when he was exactly what I needed emotionally. From the beginning, however, something wasn’t right in the bedroomI am 55 and have given up on having satisfying sex with my husband. We met 13 years ago when my life was in complete freefall – and I realised he was exactly what I needed at the time: stable, reliable and devoted. However, from the beginning, I knew something wasn’t right in the bedroom. Despite the relatively high number of women he had slept with, we never connected meaningfully. He would give no indication that he wanted me physically, let alone that he found me attractive. He made no first moves when it came to sex and when I complained he said he had come out of a bad relationship and needed time. Eleven years later, I snapped and said (during the act) that I simply couldn’t go through this again. It felt far too forced (I believe on both sides) and I realised that, on top of everything else, I no longer found him attractive. This was devastating for me (and him, I’m sure) as I realised my feelings had completely changed. So much so that I have since been putting off what I now feel to be inevitable, our separation. I know that chemistry isn’t everything in a marriage, but I think it’s equally wrong to dismiss it completely.Your husband’s lack of sexual interest is not necessarily anything to do with you. There are many reasons why a man may have low libido, so the last thing you should do is allow it to lower your self-esteem. Try to help him trust you as a loving, kind and encouraging partner in seeking a solution. Encourage him to seek medical and psychosexual answers, as he could have low testosterone, vascular problems, depression, anxiety or diabetes; there is a wide range of possibilities and they need to be explored. But consider your own part in this, too: you married him while intuitively knowing he would not readily provide the erotic connection you now feel is essential. Take some time to explore your relationship and find out if an erotic connection is possible or not. Ultimately, you may have to decide what is most important to you now.

We met 13 years ago when my life was in complete freefall – and I realised he was exactly what I needed at the time: stable, reliable and devoted. However, from the beginning, I knew something wasn’t right in the bedroom. Despite the relatively high number of women he had slept with, we never connected meaningfully. He would give no indication that he wanted me physically, let alone that he found me attractive. He made no first moves when it came to sex and when I complained he said he had come out of a bad relationship and needed time. Eleven years later, I snapped and said (during the act) that I simply couldn’t go through this again. It felt far too forced (I believe on both sides) and I realised that, on top of everything else, I no longer found him attractive. This was devastating for me (and him, I’m sure) as I realised my feelings had completely changed. So much so that I have since been putting off what I now feel to be inevitable, our separation. I know that chemistry isn’t everything in a marriage, but I think it’s equally wrong to dismiss it completely.Your husband’s lack of sexual interest is not necessarily anything to do with you. There are many reasons why a man may have low libido, so the last thing you should do is allow it to lower your self-esteem. Try to help him trust you as a loving, kind and encouraging partner in seeking a solution. Encourage him to seek medical and psychosexual answers, as he could have low testosterone, vascular problems, depression, anxiety or diabetes; there is a wide range of possibilities and they need to be explored. But consider your own part in this, too: you married him while intuitively knowing he would not readily provide the erotic connection you now feel is essential. Take some time to explore your relationship and find out if an erotic connection is possible or not. Ultimately, you may have to decide what is most important to you now.

But Anatevka, as it’s named to invoke the Jewish shtetl in the musical “Fiddler on the Roof,” has at least a walk-on role in the Donald Trump impeachment drama.Anatevka’s honorary mayor is Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s Ukraine point man, and its fundraisers include Giuliani’s two associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who’ve been indicted for funneling foreign money into U.S. political campaigns.The questions hanging over Anatevka are whether it is what its sponsors claim -- a refuge for Jews driven from eastern Ukraine by the Russian-backed separatist war -– and what role, if any, it played as Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman sought to persuade Ukrainian officials to investigate Trump’s political opponents in the U.S.The mystery begins with the residents. Only about 20 are Jews who fled the east and live in three small apartment blocks, according to two residents who asked not to be named for fear of retribution. The project’s leaders say more than 100 people live in the village; residents put the number at closer to 65, the majority Jews from nearby Kyiv, they say. A large dormitory for those displaced by the war stands empty. About 200 children attend three well-equipped schools, most bused in daily from Kyiv and nearby villages, some paying tuition.Guards in CamouflageVisitors are kept at arm’s length by guards in gray camouflage. The village’s founder, Rabbi Moshe Azman, declined repeated requests for comment.Azman has known Giuliani for about 15 years, according to people familiar with the situation. The former New York mayor made his first trip to Kyiv in 2003 to give a speech hosted by Ukrainian oligarch Vadim Rabinovich. Azman is also close to Parnas and Fruman, who say they’ve raised $500,000 for the village through a U.S. nonprofit called American Friends of Anatevka. The group’s website says they will match every dollar donated up to $1 million. Plaques highlighting contributions by Fruman hang at the boys’ school.But American Friends of Anatevka hasn’t filed a financial report in two years, so it’s not possible to verify the matching offer. The group’s accountant, Michael Koloden, declined to speak when contacted at his office in Brooklyn next to a shuttered Italian social club. A lawyer for Parnas declined to comment. Fruman’s lawyer didn’t respond to requests for comment. Giuliani declined to answer questions about Anatevka, saying he believed Bloomberg News would misinterpret or bury whatever he said.Last month, Parnas and Fruman were indicted in New York on charges of funneling foreign money into U.S. Republican political campaigns. They’ve pleaded not guilty.

But Anatevka, as it’s named to invoke the Jewish shtetl in the musical “Fiddler on the Roof,” has at least a walk-on role in the Donald Trump impeachment drama.Anatevka’s honorary mayor is Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s Ukraine point man, and its fundraisers include Giuliani’s two associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who’ve been indicted for funneling foreign money into U.S. political campaigns.The questions hanging over Anatevka are whether it is what its sponsors claim -- a refuge for Jews driven from eastern Ukraine by the Russian-backed separatist war -– and what role, if any, it played as Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman sought to persuade Ukrainian officials to investigate Trump’s political opponents in the U.S.The mystery begins with the residents. Only about 20 are Jews who fled the east and live in three small apartment blocks, according to two residents who asked not to be named for fear of retribution. The project’s leaders say more than 100 people live in the village; residents put the number at closer to 65, the majority Jews from nearby Kyiv, they say. A large dormitory for those displaced by the war stands empty. About 200 children attend three well-equipped schools, most bused in daily from Kyiv and nearby villages, some paying tuition.Guards in CamouflageVisitors are kept at arm’s length by guards in gray camouflage. The village’s founder, Rabbi Moshe Azman, declined repeated requests for comment.Azman has known Giuliani for about 15 years, according to people familiar with the situation. The former New York mayor made his first trip to Kyiv in 2003 to give a speech hosted by Ukrainian oligarch Vadim Rabinovich. Azman is also close to Parnas and Fruman, who say they’ve raised $500,000 for the village through a U.S. nonprofit called American Friends of Anatevka. The group’s website says they will match every dollar donated up to $1 million. Plaques highlighting contributions by Fruman hang at the boys’ school.But American Friends of Anatevka hasn’t filed a financial report in two years, so it’s not possible to verify the matching offer. The group’s accountant, Michael Koloden, declined to speak when contacted at his office in Brooklyn next to a shuttered Italian social club. A lawyer for Parnas declined to comment. Fruman’s lawyer didn’t respond to requests for comment. Giuliani declined to answer questions about Anatevka, saying he believed Bloomberg News would misinterpret or bury whatever he said.Last month, Parnas and Fruman were indicted in New York on charges of funneling foreign money into U.S. Republican political campaigns. They’ve pleaded not guilty.

A botched offering on social care was one of the things that derailed Theresa May’s 2017 U.K. election bid and cost the Conservatives their parliamentary majority. Her successor Boris Johnson was never going to repeat the error.It’s no surprise that the Conservative Party manifesto is minimalist on the subject. Even so, if the Tories win outright on Dec. 12, Britain’s care crisis will require more than stop-gap measures and promises. The question of how it can be fixed, and at what price, has been almost as bedeviling as Brexit for the country. The difference is that for the first time, agreement is starting to emerge.It couldn’t come soon enough. If a measure of civilized society is how it treats the elderly and those who cannot care for themselves, then Britain is a backwards place. Its social care system is one of the poorest among comparable advanced countries, with some 1.4 million unable to get help with very basic needs, from dressing and bathing to support for dementia and autism.Social care (called long-term care in the U.S.) is underfunded, fragmented and disconnected from medical care generally. State-funded provision is means tested with all but the very neediest forced to pay. Even then, services are hugely overstretched, staff are poorly paid, training is bare bones and turnover rates for workers are 30%. The quality and availability of care varies dramatically by local authority.What about Britain’s vaunted National Health Service? From its founding, it was focused on medical interventions, with large resources dedicated to acute care, while long-term care was left to local councils, whose budgets have been cut by Conservative governments, falling an estimated 49% in real terms between 2010-2011 and 2017-2018.The system is also unfair. While a well-off person with cancer will be treated on the NHS for free (or taxpayer-funded, more accurately), a poorer person recovering from a stroke or who has dementia would have to fund their own social care until their assets fell below the very low threshold for state help. Those industrious or lucky enough to save for a period of prolonged care will be asked to pay fees that are 41% higher for a care home place than what local government pays for a similar place.Private savings and the unpaid help of family and friends are propping up the system. While about 21 billion pounds ($27 billion) is spent by government on social care in England, another 10.9 billion pounds is spent by people self-funding their care. An estimated 5.4 million people are delivering unpaid care (often leaving jobs to do so), work that’s valued at between 58.6 billion pounds and nearly 100 billion pounds by the National Audit Office.The crisis is going to get worse. More than one-fifth of Britons will be older than 65 in 2030, compared to 15.8% in 1991. One in 10 hospital beds already contains an elderly person who didn’t need to be hospitalized but who didn’t have the care in place to make discharge safe. Delays in discharging patients cost the NHS about 1 billion pounds a year, according to a 2016 NAO report.Things have been so bad for so long that Johnson pledged in his first speech to “fix the crisis in social care once and for all.” Indeed, his pledge on social care and health-care spending is central to his pitch to working class Brexit voters, for whom the Tories have always been the party of the rich.There are different models for social care around; even the U.S. one, which mostly exempts the family home and basic assets from means testing, is more generous than Britain’s. But the most successful systems include a combination of compulsory insurance, subsidies and cost-sharing. Japan, where more than 28% of the population is over 65, is one such model. Nearly a decade ago, it put in place a system financed through taxes, compulsory insurance and user co-payments. To answer charges of inter-generational unfairness, only those aged over 40 pay in. Users contribute 10% toward the costs of their care, though low-earners have their costs capped.The problem in Britain has been the politics. Over the past two decades, there have been a dozen government consultation papers and five independent reviews and commissions on the subject. For a long time, it’s been easier to do nothing than to act.In 2010, a Labour idea to fund care through an estate levy was denounced as a “death tax.” May’s 2017 plan, though an improvement, was branded a “dementia tax.” She dropped it and promised a consultation paper instead. That was delayed more than six times, which Health Secretary Matt Hancock blamed on “parliamentary logjam and a lack of cross-party consensus.”Richard Sloggett, a former special adviser to Hancock, saw the challenges first-hand. Getting cross-party support wasn’t the only obstacle. Within the Conservative Party —  a bastion of more limited government — there were strong disagreements over how far care should be covered by the state. The backdrop, however, appears to be changing. “Rather than looking to insurance markets and other mechanisms, there is now a view that there has to be a government-backed solution,” says Sloggett.He notes that both the Labour and Tory manifestos put the state front and center. “This platform provides cautious optimism for potential cross-party agreement.”Labour is offering free care for the over 65s, though that doesn’t include residential care. The Tory manifesto promises an extra billion pounds a year to keep the current system afloat and pledges to work across party lines to find long-term solutions. Is that can-kicking? Maybe it’s political realism.“I don’t hold it against the prime minister that they have not put in some proposal that would be a complex hostage to fortune,” notes Warwick Lightfoot, one of the authors of a Policy Exchange paper that proposes funding social care similarly to the NHS and which was endorsed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative in Johnson’s cabinet. Lightfoot and his coauthors calculate the provision would require an additional 0.5% of GDP, or 1.3% of total public spending, sums that “are not trivial but are manageable.”After years of paralysis, there may now be something like political agreement on the direction of travel. But what the new system would look like, how much it will cost and how to get agreement on the details — in other words, the hard work — lies ahead.

Almost everywhere in between — from France to the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Italy — they’re in various states of disarray or dissolution. What happened? And is their decline terminal?That’s what Germany’s SPD, founded 156 years ago as the ancestor of the movement, should be asking itself, as it convenes next week to anoint new leaders and decide whether to quit its coalition with the conservative bloc of Chancellor Angela Merkel. But this more existential question won’t be debated, at least not honestly.To get the big picture, look at the chart below. It shows the percentage of eligible voters in the Federal Republic of Germany who plumped for the SPD in national elections. What you see is a rise in the postwar years, when the SPD formally dropped its Marxist doctrines to appeal to potentially all Germans, not just the blue-collar types. The SPD then peaked in the 1970s under two Social Democratic chancellors, Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt, who promised to lift more people into prosperity.But in the 1980s and 90s, the ideological left wing of the party fought back. Lifting up was de-emphasized. Leveling down was the new message, as the SPD cast aspersions on “the rich.” Its support dwindled. The lifters briefly prevailed again over the levelers in 1998, putting the third Social Democrat in the chancellery, Gerhard Schroeder. But since then the levelers have dominated rhetorically. According to polls, the next bar in this chart will be the smallest yet.Something similar has taken place around the neighborhood. The equivalent party in France, called PS, had an absolute majority of the National Assembly in 2012, then got overrun by the brand-new centrist movement of President Emmanuel Macron; it’s now irrelevant. Its Italian sister, called PD, is in government again, but as a much diminished junior partner to populists. Emulating Macron, Matteo Renzi, the PD’s former star, will quit and form his own party. One lesson is that Social Democrats, not unlike the Democrats in the U.S., do well whenever they promise opportunity and badly whenever they preach, as Winston Churchill put it, “the gospel of envy.” But envy is all they’ve got these days. Hence calls by Germany’s SPD (and others) to bring back a wealth tax, even though it was suspended in the 1990s because it was a nightmare to assess and brought in little revenue.Another lesson: You can’t just keep looking for new demographic groups that allegedly suffer some urgent “injustice” that must be fixed (by Social Democrats, of course). But that’s what the SPD keeps trying. It has just spent months haggling with its coalition partners to top up the state pensions of low-income retirees who’ve paid into the system for 35 years or more. Why not 34 years? Nobody knows. Not discussed was the unsustainability of the whole pension system, in which ever fewer young people will pay ever more of their income to ever more old people. As usual, the SPD is baffled that it hasn’t risen in the polls.The bigger insight is that the Social Democrats are simply out of ideas and out of date. They sprang from the second industrial revolution, when workers eked out miserable and unsafe existences in factories, smelting ores or bashing metals. Just by fighting for the right to safe workplaces and paid leave, Social Democrats did lift many people up. But today, at the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, that proletariat is disappearing. Unions are shrinking. Jobs are moving into the service sector and the gig economy. Brains are more important than brawn.The new threat to workers is not from “capitalists” but from artificial intelligence, automation and the Internet of Things. Some very low-wage jobs (such as janitors) are pretty safe. Many high-wage jobs (the creative and brainy ones) will boom. But in between, many professions — especially those based on routines or algorithms, whether in manufacturing or administration — could well disappear. Overall, society will be better off. But for many individuals, the transition will be hell. What about them?Beats the Social Democrats. Rhetorically, they enjoy calling for “fresh” thinking. So what did Kevin Kuehnert, the allegedly up-and-coming 30-year-old leader of the SPD’s youth organization, come up with? He recently had a brainstorm — wait for it — to collectivize BMW. Bold and visionary, in a bygone century.Nobody in politics has yet found convincing and comprehensive answers to the twin challenges or our time: reconciling the economy and ecology on a heating planet, and assuring social cohesion as technology first supplements, then competes with, human intelligence. The answers will eventually touch everything from education to taxation, welfare and consumption. There are people probing deeply and curiously into these fields.

Report Finds World Heading to Climate Catastrophes","summary":"Four years after countries struck a landmark deal in Paris to rein in greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to avert the worst effects of global warming, humanity is headed toward those very climate catastrophes, according to a U.N. report issued Tuesday, with China and the United States, the two biggest polluters, having expanded their carbon footprints last year.&quot;The summary findings are bleak,&quot; the report said, because countries have failed to halt the rise of greenhouse gas emissions even after repeated warnings from scientists. The result, the authors added, is that &quot;deeper and faster cuts are now required.&quot;The world&#39;s 20 richest countries, responsible for more than three-fourths of emissions, must take the biggest, swiftest steps to move away from fossil fuels, the report emphasized. The richest country of all, the United States, however, has formally begun to pull out of the Paris accord altogether.Global greenhouse gas emissions have grown by 1.5% every year over the past decade, according to the annual assessment, the Emissions Gap Report, which is produced by the U.N. Environment Program. The opposite must happen if the world is to avoid the worst effects of climate change, including more intense droughts, stronger storms and widespread food insecurity by midcentury. To stay within relatively safe limits, emissions must decline sharply, by 7.6% every year, between 2020 and 2030, the report warned.Separately, the World Meteorological Organization reported Monday that emissions of three major greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide -- have all swelled in the atmosphere since the mid-18th century.Under the Paris agreement, reached in November 2015, every country has pledged to rein in emissions, with each setting its own targets and timetables. Even if every country fulfills its current pledges -- and many, including the United States, Brazil and Australia, are currently not on track to do so -- the Emissions Gap Report found average temperatures are on track to rise by 3.2 degrees Celsius from the baseline average temperature at the start of the industrial age.According to scientific models, that kind of temperature rise sharply increases the likelihood of extreme weather events, the accelerated melting of glaciers and swelling seas -- all endangering the lives of billions of people.The Paris agreement resolved to hold the increase in global temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit; last year, a U.N.-backed panel of scientists said the safer limit was to keep it to 1.5 degrees Celsius.There are many ways to reduce emissions: quitting the combustion of fossil fuels, especially coal, the world&#39;s dirtiest fossil fuel; switching to renewable energy like solar and wind power; moving away from gas- and diesel-guzzling cars; and halting deforestation.In fact, many countries are headed in the wrong direction. A separate analysis released this month looked at how much coal, oil and natural gas the world&#39;s nations have said they expect to produce and sell through 2030. If all those fossil fuels were ultimately extracted and burned, the report found, countries would collectively miss their climate pledges, as well as the global 2 degree Celsius target, by an even larger margin than previously thought.A number of countries, including Canada and Norway, have made plans to reduce emissions at home while expanding fossil-fuel production for sale abroad, that report noted.&quot;At a global level, it doesn&#39;t add up,&quot; said Michael Lazarus, a lead author of the report and director of the Stockholm Environment Institute&#39;s U.S. Center.To date, he noted, discussions on whether and how to curb the production of fossil fuels have been almost entirely absent from international climate talks.The International Energy Agency recently singled out the proliferation of SUVs, noting that the surge of SUVs, which consume more gasoline than conventional cars, could wipe out much of the oil savings from a nascent electric-car boom.Diplomats are scheduled to gather in Madrid in December for the next round of negotiations over the rules of the Paris agreement. The world&#39;s biggest polluters are under pressure to raise their pledges.&quot;This is a new and stark reminder,&quot; Spain&#39;s minister for ecological transition, Teresa Ribera, said of the Emissions Gap Report in an email. &quot;We urgently need to align with the Paris agreement objectives and elevate climate ambition.&quot;If there is any good news in the report, it is that the current trajectory is not as dire as it was before countries around the world started taking steps to cut their emissions. The 2015 Emissions Gap Report said that, without any climate policies at all, the world was likely to face around 4 degrees Celsius of warming.Coal use is declining sharply, especially in the United States and Western Europe, according to an analysis by Carbon Brief. Renewable energy is expanding fast, though not nearly as fast as necessary. And city and state governments around the world, including in the United States, are rolling out stricter rules on tailpipe pollution from cars.Those who have followed the diplomatic negotiations say they are confronted by something of a cognitive dissonance when they think about this moment. The world&#39;s biggest polluters are nowhere near where they should be to draw down their emissions at a time when the human toll of climate change is near impossible to ignore.And yet, renewable energy is spreading faster than could have been anticipated even a few years ago; electric buses and cars are proliferating and young people are protesting by the millions in rich and poor countries alike. Even in the United States, with its persistent denialist movement, how to deal with climate change is a resonant issue in the presidential campaign.&quot;There&#39;s a bit of a best of times, worst of times about this,&quot; said David Waskow, director of the international climate initiative at the World Resources Institute, a research and advocacy group.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company","description":"Four years after countries struck a landmark deal in Paris to rein in greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to avert the worst effects of global warming, humanity is headed toward those very climate catastrophes, according to a U.N. report issued Tuesday, with China and the United States, the two biggest polluters, having expanded their carbon footprints last year.&quot;The summary findings are bleak,&quot; the report said, because countries have failed to halt the rise of greenhouse gas emissions even after repeated warnings from scientists.

Then the man took him to the school library, locked the door and raped him, the boy said.At the same school, a 17-year-old boy reported similar treatment from the school&#39;s principal. He said the man had threatened to kill him if he told anyone.But the boys did talk, giving their accounts to a child advocacy group in their province and repeating them later in interviews with The New York Times. The advocacy group discovered that those two boys were not the only victims. From just three schools in one area of Logar province, south of the Afghan capital, the group said it had taken statements from 165 boys who said they had been sexually abused at their schools or by local officials they went to for help.Now, Afghanistan is again caught up in discussion of rampant sexual abuse of children and of a deep reluctance by many officials to deal with the issue at all.After talking with the TOLO news channel about the investigation, the leader of the Logar advocacy group, Mohammad Musa, and a colleague, Ehsanullah Hamidi, were detained by Afghanistan&#39;s national intelligence agency late last week, the group says.On Monday, former President Hamid Karzai said that if verified, the detention of Musa by the intelligence agency was &quot;a very wrong thing.&quot;A spokesman for the National Directorate of Security declined to comment Monday. Musa has not been reachable for comment since late Thursday.Robert A. Destro, the assistant secretary of state, said on Twitter that the United States was closely following the case and was &quot;greatly concerned.&quot; He called on the Afghan government &quot;to take action to protect survivors and bring perpetrators to justice.&quot;It is unclear whether the cases at the three schools are related. But the prevalence of systematic sexual abuse of boys in Afghanistan has been a problem for generations. Bacha bazi -- it means boy play -- is common among men in powerful positions who keep boys as sex slaves. Bacha bazi boys are forced to dress as girls and to dance for men before being raped. Sometimes the boys are prostituted to the highest bidder.In an interview with The New York Times this month, Musa said that his group -- the Logar Youth, Social and Civil Institution -- began intensively investigating after a troubling Facebook post in May that showed men with boys in sexual positions. One video provided by the group shows a teenage boy dancing barefoot for about two dozen men who stand or sit in a circle around him.The post came down quickly, Musa said, but the group was able to preserve many of the images. Some of the boys were recognizable and had complained of sexual abuse before, he said.The Logar group began methodically talking to students in the area, finding dozens who said they had been raped. Many of their accounts were confirmed by teachers or other people in the area, who along with four of the boys were also interviewed by The Times.As the accounts unfolded, at least seven boys who said they had been raped were found dead, Musa said, most likely at the hands of their own families.Musa said that the advocacy group took the boys&#39; statements to Logar provincial police but that no action was taken. He said several boys who had agreed to be questioned by police were subsequently raped by officers.Shapoor Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the Logar provincial police, said the accusations were false. &quot;Nobody has come to the police for rape cases,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s just rumors.&quot;The Logar provincial governor, Mohammad Anwar Ashaqzai, said officials were examining boys&#39; statements provided by the advocacy group. He said he was not aware of any rapes in the province&#39;s schools.&quot;If we find these documents are incomplete and they are fake, then those who are involved will face the law and should be punished,&quot; Ashaqzai said.Still, in response to the group&#39;s accusations, the Ministry of Education in Kabul said Nov. 14 that it was sending a delegation to the province to investigate.In Logar, Shafiullah Afghanzai, the executive officer of Hamid Karzai high school, where the 14-year-old and the 17-year-old said they had been raped, told The Times that the school&#39;s headmaster had been transferred to another district earlier this year after he was accused of sexually assaulting a boy.Afghanzai said boys had also been raped by teachers at two other schools in the province. He said three boys who had reported rapes were later killed by the Taliban, who condemn the sexual abuse as anti-Islamic.&quot;If they get evidence that teachers were involved, they will hang them,&quot; Afghanzai said of the militants.A Taliban spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.Hassibullah Stanikzai, head of the Logar provincial council, said the bodies of several boys had been found in areas of Logar under Taliban control. But he said there was no evidence that their deaths were related to sexual assault.A teacher at one school in Logar, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Hamid, said he had spoken to 13 boys who said they had been raped by teachers there. He said the families of three of those boys had moved away to avoid the social stigma of rape, especially after images were posted on Facebook.&quot;It&#39;s a crisis,&quot; Hamid said. &quot;We want to do something to stop this mafia, but we don&#39;t know what to do.&quot;Musa, of the advocacy group, said 25 families abandoned their homes in shame after their sons said they had been raped. In some cases, he said, the boys&#39; faces had been visible in images on the anonymous Facebook page before it was taken down.In several cases, boys had been banished from home by their fathers, Musa said.&quot;We don&#39;t trust anyone, neither the Taliban nor the government,&quot; Musa said. One school is in an area contested by the Taliban, and two are in government-controlled areas. Wakil Kaliwal, head of the education department in Logar, said there were perhaps one or two cases of student rape in the province&#39;s schools but no epidemic of sexual assault. He said the principal at Hamid Karzai high school had been transferred for beating a boy but also had been accused of raping another boy.Kaliwal added, referring to sexual assaults of boys: &quot;It is an issue across the country, and Logar isn&#39;t exceptional.&quot;Mohammad Qasim Sediqqi, a member of the Logar provincial council, said there was no evidence of widespread rape in schools. &quot;Maybe there are one or two cases, because this is Afghanistan, and crime exists everywhere,&quot; he said.President Ashraf Ghani, who is from Logar, promised in 2015 to crack down on bacha bazi. But pederasty is still widely tolerated in Afghan culture, and prosecutions of men who sexually assault boys are rare.An investigation by The New York Times in 2015 found widespread sexual assault of boys by the Afghan security forces or others in power and that the U.S. military was reluctant to intervene. The article reported that an American captain was relieved of command and a first sergeant was pressured to retire after they confronted and shoved an Afghan militia commander who had raped a boy. That article led to a report by the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction on the military&#39;s reticence to confront the abuse.Afghanistan made bacha bazi and related offenses violations of the national criminal code in May 2017. The penalty for violating the code is up to three years in prison -- three to five years if the dancing is &quot;a public event.&quot; If a teacher, instructor or &quot;superior in any way is involved,&quot; the penalty is five years in prison.But Charu Lata Hogg, executive director of All Survivors Project, a human rights group based in Liechtenstein, said the group interviewed 24 male rape victims in four Afghan provinces, not including Logar.&quot;We found that sexual violence against boys and young men is pervasive and happens within communities, police checkpoints and in detention settings,&quot; Hogg said.She said her group welcomed the 2017 laws, but she added that authorities must &quot;apply the law and hold perpetrators to account.&quot;In a 2018 report, the United Nations documented 78 cases of sexual assault against boys in Afghanistan, adding, &quot;Impunity for perpetrators remains a serious challenge.&quot;Shaharzad Akbar, chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, called on authorities to investigate the Logar allegations and prosecute anyone involved. She asked government officials to protect members of the advocacy group and refrain from &quot;the language of fear and intimidation.&quot;Amnesty International warned that the two detained rights activists were at risk of torture &quot;and other ill treatment&quot; as long as they remained in custody.Lyla Lynn Schwartz, who counsels victims of trauma in Afghanistan, including rape, said Afghan boys raped by men often suffer extreme emotional and psychological distress, often for the rest of their lives. The victims are often ostracized, or even attacked, by their family members over a perceived dishonor.The 17-year-old from Hamid Karzai high school said in an interview that he was left homeless after his father banished him. He said he no longer attends school.&quot;My father says if he sees me again,&quot; he said, &quot;he will kill me.&quot;This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company","description":"KABUL, Afghanistan -- The 14-year-old Afghan boy said his teacher had asked him for &quot;a little favor&quot; in return for not failing him on his final exams. Then the man took him to the school library, locked the door and raped him, the boy said.At the same school, a 17-year-old boy reported similar treatment from the school&#39;s principal. He said the man had threatened to kill him if he told anyone.But the boys did talk, giving their accounts to a child advocacy group in their province and repeating them later in interviews with The New York Times. The advocacy group discovered that those two boys were not the only victims. From just three schools in one area of Logar province, south of the Afghan capital, the group said it had taken statements from 165 boys who said they had been sexually abused at their schools or by local officials they went to for help.Now, Afghanistan is again caught up in discussion of rampant sexual abuse of children and of a deep reluctance by many officials to deal with the issue at all.After talking with the TOLO news channel about the investigation, the leader of the Logar advocacy group, Mohammad Musa, and a colleague, Ehsanullah Hamidi, were detained by Afghanistan&#39;s national intelligence agency late last week, the group says.On Monday, former President Hamid Karzai said that if verified, the detention of Musa by the intelligence agency was &quot;a very wrong thing.&quot;A spokesman for the National Directorate of Security declined to comment Monday. Musa has not been reachable for comment since late Thursday.Robert A. Destro, the assistant secretary of state, said on Twitter that the United States was closely following the case and was &quot;greatly concerned.&quot; He called on the Afghan government &quot;to take action to protect survivors and bring perpetrators to justice.&quot;It is unclear whether the cases at the three schools are related. But the prevalence of systematic sexual abuse of boys in Afghanistan has been a problem for generations. Bacha bazi -- it means boy play -- is common among men in powerful positions who keep boys as sex slaves. Bacha bazi boys are forced to dress as girls and to dance for men before being raped. Sometimes the boys are prostituted to the highest bidder.In an interview with The New York Times this month, Musa said that his group -- the Logar Youth, Social and Civil Institution -- began intensively investigating after a troubling Facebook post in May that showed men with boys in sexual positions. One video provided by the group shows a teenage boy dancing barefoot for about two dozen men who stand or sit in a circle around him.The post came down quickly, Musa said, but the group was able to preserve many of the images. Some of the boys were recognizable and had complained of sexual abuse before, he said.The Logar group began methodically talking to students in the area, finding dozens who said they had been raped. Many of their accounts were confirmed by teachers or other people in the area, who along with four of the boys were also interviewed by The Times.As the accounts unfolded, at least seven boys who said they had been raped were found dead, Musa said, most likely at the hands of their own families.Musa said that the advocacy group took the boys&#39; statements to Logar provincial police but that no action was taken. He said several boys who had agreed to be questioned by police were subsequently raped by officers.Shapoor Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the Logar provincial police, said the accusations were false. &quot;Nobody has come to the police for rape cases,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s just rumors.&quot;The Logar provincial governor, Mohammad Anwar Ashaqzai, said officials were examining boys&#39; statements provided by the advocacy group.

Labour trails Boris Johnson’s Conservatives going into the Dec. 12 election, but appeared to have secured a poll boost on the back of plans to dramatically reshape the British economy.In a speech in north London on Tuesday, Corbyn said antisemitism is “vile and wrong,” and pledged to protect “all places of worship” in the U.K.Must read: U.K. Chief Rabbi Says Corbyn’s Labour Is Poisoned Against JewsComing up:U.K.’s Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis says Labour can “no longer claim to be the party of equality and anti-racism”Corbyn defends Labour Party’s response to antisemitism casesBBC interview with the Labour leader airs at 7 p.m.Johnson is campaigning in Scotland, where he warned that a Labour win would see Corbyn’s party working with the SNPAn ICM/Reuters poll released Monday put the Conservatives on 41%, Labour on 34%, Liberal Democrats on 13% and the Brexit Party on 4%Javid Won’t Guarantee Reaching Tax Goal (3:55 p.m.)Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid said he can’t promise when the Conservatives will meet their ultimate target for the threshold at which workers pay national insurance.He said that in his first budget, he would increase it to 9,500 pounds, which would save around 85 pounds per person. But as to the party’s wider goal of raising it to 12,500 pounds, he said: “At every budget we will look to see how much further we can go.”“I can’t say to you today it will definitely be done in x years or by the end of the parliament,” he said. “We will do it as we can afford it as a country, but I am confident that we can keep making progress towards that goal at each budget.”Javid Pledges Tory Probe into Islamophobia (3:45 p.m.)Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid promised the Conservatives will set up an inquiry into Islamophobia in the party before the end of the year.“We will never ever as a party tolerate anyone amongst our ranks that has any kind of prejudice towards any group of people,” Javid, who is of Muslim heritage, said in Bolton, northern England. Labour “has been contaminated with the cancer of antisemitism, and that cancer begins at the top.”Javid contrasted accusations of Islamophobia in the Tory party with those of antisemitism in Labour, saying “no-one has ever credibly suggested it’s an issue with the leadership” of the Conservatives. When asked about an article by Boris Johnson describing women in Muslim dress as looking like “letterboxes,” he said the prime minister has given a “perfectly valid explanation.”Muslim Council Attacks Tories Over Islamophobia (1:45 p.m.)It’s not just Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party under fire over its record on tackling racism and prejudice. The Muslim Council of Britain -- which represents over 500 mosques and charities across the U.K. -- accused the Conservatives of approaching Islamophobia with “denial, dismissal and conceit” in a statement which welcomed the chief rabbi’s comments on Labour.“It is abundantly clear to many Muslims that the Conservative Party tolerate Islamophobia, allow it to fester in society, and fail to put in place the measures necessary to root out this type of racism” the council said. “It is as if the Conservative Party has a blind spot for this type of racism.”Boris Johnson was widely criticized for a 2018 newspaper column in which he said Muslim women who wear burqas look like “letter boxes.” During the Tory leadership campaign, candidates including Johnson committed to holding an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party.Johnson Slams Corbyn’s Record on Antisemitism (1:10 p.m.)Boris Johnson criticized what he called Jeremy Corbyn’s “failure” to tackle antisemitism in his party, and sought to draw parallels with the Labour leader’s equivocation over Brexit.“I do think it is a very serious business when the chief rabbi speaks as he does,” Johnson said at an event in Scotland. “I’ve never known anything like it, and clearly it is a failure of leadership on the part of the Labour leader that he has not been able to stamp out this virus in the Labour Party.”Corbyn’s failure to stem antisemitism in Labour is “cognate with a general failure of leadership that we’re seeing at this moment” on Brexit, Johnson said. “You cannot be neutral on something like this any more than you can be neutral, frankly, on antisemitism.”Corbyn: Antisemitism Is ‘Vile and Wrong’ (1 p.m.)Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn responded to criticism from the U.K.’s chief rabbi, which risks undermining his campaign ahead of the general election on Dec. 12.Antisemitism is “vile and wrong,” Corbyn said in a speech in Tottenham, north London. “There is no place whatsoever for antisemitism in any shape or form or in any place whatsoever in modern Britain, and under a Labour government it will not be tolerated whatsoever. I want to make that clear.”Corbyn said Labour has a “rapid and effective system” for handling antisemitism cases which is “constantly under review to make sure it is rapid and effective.” He also said he’s “proud” to lead what he described as a “party of diversity.”Johnson: No Referendums Even If No Majority (12:40 p.m.)Boris Johnson ruled out holding a second referendum on either Scottish independence or the U.K.’s European Union membership -- even if he finds himself in a minority government after the Dec. 12 general election.“I genuinely think they would be bad for our country,” Johnson said in Fife, Scotland at the launch of the Scottish Conservative manifesto. “It’s not the way forward now. We need to honor democracy.”The red line leaves Johnson with few options if he does find himself with the biggest party in Parliament but no outright majority. That’s because Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party all want a second referendum on Brexit, while the SNP is demanding a second vote on Scottish independence. Johnson has also alienated the Tories’ traditional allies in Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party, with his Brexit deal.Labour’s Shah: Party Should Have Acted Sooner (11:30 a.m.)Labour’s women and equalities spokeswoman Naz Shah said the party should have acted faster on instances of antisemitism and to rebuild trust with the Jewish community.“It is not acceptable that the Jewish community does not feel that the Labour Party is its natural home,” Shah told the BBC on Tuesday. “We haven’t been as good as we could be, we need to get better even today. We could do things differently, we do need to do much better at it and that means listening and that means responding accordingly to the Jewish community.”Jeremy Corbyn’s party launches its race and faith manifesto shortly in Tottenham, north London, and the furore over the intervention by the U.K.’s chief rabbi will inevitably dominate proceedings.Corbyn’s Spending Blitz Wins Economists’ Backing (Earlier)Former Bank of England policy maker Danny Blanchflower and more than 160 other economists and academics have backed the Labour Party’s election promises as the best way to help the U.K. economy.In a letter published in the Financial Times, the economists said productivity growth has all but stagnated over the past decade and more public investment is needed, particularly into green technology aimed at energy, transport, housing, industry and farming.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s plans include an extra 83 billion pounds ($108 billion) of day-to-day spending and 55 billion pounds more for investment, which amounts to about six pounds of new spending for every one pledged by Boris Johnson’s Conservatives.Gove: Rabbi’s Labour Intervention ‘Unprecedented’ (Earlier)Cabinet minister Michael Gove called criticism of Labour by the U.K.’s chief rabbi Ephraim Mirvis “an unprecedented intervention in a general election.”“Jeremy Corbyn has been warned about antisemitism at the heart of his party for years now,” Gove told Talk Radio on Tuesday. “The chief rabbi has confirmed that Jeremy Corbyn just hasn’t taken the action required.”But Labour’s faith envoy Stephen Timms told the same station “steps have been taken to deal with” antisemitism in the party, and accused Gove’s Tories of ignoring its own problems with racism and prejudice.“There have been problems of antisemitism in the Tory Party as well, as well as a very big problem of Islamophobia which the Tory party has largely ignored,” said Timms, a Labour member of Parliament.Johnson, Corbyn Dig Up Old Attack Lines (Earlier)Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are digging up attack lines from past elections as they seek to get an edge ahead of the Dec. 12 election.Johnson’s Conservatives on Tuesday said a Labour win would see Corbyn’s party, allied with Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish National Party, spending next year -- and 150 million pounds ($194 million) -- holding fresh referendums on Scottish independence and the U.K.’s EU membership. That revives their 2015 warning that Labour would form a “coalition of chaos” with Sturgeon, which helped David Cameron win a surprise majority.Labour, meanwhile, unveiled a “pledge card” for pensioners including a 10.8 billion-pound package for social care, and said the Tories couldn’t be trusted to look after the elderly. That sparks memories of the 2017 campaign when Labour branded the Tory social care plan a “dementia tax,” helping to derail Theresa May’s bid to extend her majority.Read more: Labour, Tories Dig Up Old Attack Lines in Bid for U.K. PowerAnti-Brexit Tories Ramp Up Johnson Criticism (Earlier)Conservative grandee Michael Heseltine urged voters to back the Liberal Democrats and accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of pursuing an “utterly disastrous” policy on Brexit.“The real issue is what is at stake and it is the prosperity of this country, the world influence of this country, our relationship with our neighbors in Europe,” Heseltine told BBC radio on Tuesday. “I cannot vote or support people who are going to make the country poorer or less influential.”It’s the latest example of anti-Brexit Conservatives trying to make their voices heard in the run up to the Dec. 12 vote. On Monday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab’s Tory predecessor in his Esher and Walton constituency in south of London said voters should back for the Liberal Democrat candidate.“Brexit has scrambled traditional party allegiances,” Ian Taylor, who held Esher and Walton for 23 years until 2010, said on Twitter. “It is not a time for tribal party loyalties.”Read more: Threat to Raab Shows the Shifting Loyalties of U.K. VotersEarlier:Four Ways the U.K. Election Could Play Out for BrexitLabour, Tories Dig Up Old Attack Lines in Bid for U.K. PowerThreat to Raab Shows the Shifting Loyalties of U.K. Voters&#92;--With assistance from Andrew Atkinson and Kitty Donaldson.To contact the reporters on this story: Alex Morales in London at amorales2@bloomberg.net;Greg Ritchie in London at gritchie10@bloomberg.net;Jessica Shankleman in London at jshankleman@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Stuart Biggs, Andrew AtkinsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","description":"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our Brexit Bulletin, follow us @Brexit and subscribe to our podcast.Jeremy Corbyn is again embroiled in a row over antisemitism, after the U.K.’s chief rabbi suggested the Labour leader is unfit for high office and said a “new poison -- sanctioned from the very top -- has taken root” in his party.

In the past it has mostly been Labour Brexiters who have complained about EU state aid rules limiting the ability of the government to use subsidies to help struggling companies, while the Conservatives have been wary of policies that meddle with market economics. But at the news conference Johnson claimed that change was necessary because “the ramifications of EU state aid rules are felt everywhere”. The Institute of Directors, a free-market business organisation, and the Institute of Economic Affairs, a libertarian thinktank, both strongly criticised the new Tory approach, with the IoD describing this as “like a bad solution in search of the wrong problem”. But the small print of the Conservative announcement suggests that Johnson is planning relatively modest changes to the current regime, rather than a wholesale shift towards 1970s socialism, and it has also been pointed out that any attempt to diverge very far from current EU-style rules would make negotiating a UK-EU free trade deal much harder. At his press conference Johnson also insisted that the Conservatives were the change option at the election, because no other party would take advantages of the opportunities for reform offered by Brexit.

(“Sorry mate, no trainers.”) Too much time spent in the back of a Vauxhall Corsa eating chips and scraps rather than engaging with lessons on iambic pentameter.To make things worse, 2019 has been a year of Dreams. Theatrical behemoths the Bridge, the Globe and Regent’s Park Open Air theatre have all staged grand productions with grand budgets and starry casting. In contrast, our National Youth Theatre Rep company have 16 emerging artists and the support of a youth arts charity. For me, this isn’t a reason to lament – it’s a gift. A catalyst for distilling ideas. We’re still watching Shakespeare because at the heart of his stories are characters in which we recognise ourselves, experiencing things we can relate to. To illuminate the heart of this play, I needed to answer two questions: why does this story need to be told? And why am I the person to tell it? The key was the piece’s location. We have moved it out of the big city to what we have called “Athens on Sea” a place heavily inspired by Whitby, the North Yorkshire seaside town that made me.

We forget the sheer, throbbing, agonisingly frantic desire of it all: the way your brain seems to be pulling apart in as many directions as your muscles are; the craving for money and freedom and a provisional driving licence. To be a teenager is to have your brain stretched thin and pinned to a rack and have someone whisper “Harry Styles” to you in a way that makes you die and live at exactly the same time. It’s to really care about posters and shoplifting and still get a thrill of illicit excitement every time you hold a lighter. It is an emotionally fragile time, is what I’m saying. You have no empathy and most of your emotional complexity is expressed through shutting a door really, really hard. This is what adulthood teaches us to forget.Good, then, that Just Tattoo of Us (MTV, 10pm, Monday) is back, the glossiest and most bombastic of TV’s one million tattoo-based franchises, and also the closest synthesis to inhabiting the pent-up mind of a teen currently available. If you are unfamiliar with the show: members of the public go to a studio that looks as if police just cleared a rave out of it, to get a tattoo. The tattoo is designed by the partner you came in with and so, quite often, it is the worst possible design in the universe.

We forget the sheer, throbbing, agonisingly frantic desire of it all: the way your brain seems to be pulling apart in as many directions as your muscles are; the craving for money and freedom and a provisional driving licence. To be a teenager is to have your brain stretched thin and pinned to a rack and have someone whisper “Harry Styles” to you in a way that makes you die and live at exactly the same time. It’s to really care about posters and shoplifting and still get a thrill of illicit excitement every time you hold a lighter. It is an emotionally fragile time, is what I’m saying. You have no empathy and most of your emotional complexity is expressed through shutting a door really, really hard. This is what adulthood teaches us to forget.Good, then, that Just Tattoo of Us (MTV, 10pm, Monday) is back, the glossiest and most bombastic of TV’s one million tattoo-based franchises, and also the closest synthesis to inhabiting the pent-up mind of a teen currently available.

The tattoo is designed by the partner you came in with and so, quite often, it is the worst possible design in the universe.

The new drug, called Quadrimune, comes in strawberry-flavored granules the size of grains of sugar that can be mixed with milk or sprinkled on baby cereal. Experts said it could save the lives of thousands of children each year.&quot;This is excellent news for all children living with HIV,&quot; said Winnie Byanyima, the new executive director of UNAIDS, the United Nations agency in charge of the fight against the disease. &quot;We have been eagerly waiting for child-friendly medicines that are easy to use and good to taste.&quot;Cipla revolutionized the provision of AIDS drugs for adults almost two decades ago, pricing them at $1 a day. The new pediatric formulation will likewise be priced at $1 a day. The announcement by Cipla and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, an offshoot of Doctors Without Borders that supported the development of the drug, was timed to coincide with World AIDS Day, which is Sunday.Despite big advances in the prevention of mother-child transmission of HIV, about 160,000 children are still born infected each year, according to UNAIDS, mostly in the poorest towns and villages of Africa. Almost half of them die before age 2, usually because they have no access to drugs or cannot tolerate them.Quadrimune is still under review by the Food and Drug Administration, and FDA approval almost inevitably leads to rapid certification by the World Health Organization. The company hopes to get a decision by May.Trials in healthy adults showed that the new formulation gets the drugs into the blood; the four drugs in it were approved in the 1990s and are used in many combinations.A clinical trial in HIV-infected infants, run by Epicentre, the research arm of Doctors Without Borders, is now underway in Uganda to prove to African health ministries that children accept the new formulation. Most of the research costs have been paid by UNITAID, a Geneva-based organization set up by​ France, Norway, Brazil and some other countries ​which imposed special taxes on airline flights that are dedicated to ​bettering​ global health.Currently, the most common pediatric drug combination includes a syrup that is 40% alcohol, has a bitter metallic taste that lingers for hours and must be transported in cold trucks and then kept in a refrigerator -- something that many poor rural families do not own.&quot;Some families try to bury it in wet sand or dirt to keep it cool,&quot; said Dr. Bernard Pecoul, executive director of the neglected diseases initiative. &quot;And the children are vomiting it on a regular basis.&quot;Moreover, each drug must be squirted into a child&#39;s mouth with a separate syringe, so a mother must have up to four syringes on hand and clean them for each subsequent use. Children generally have to take the medicines twice a day for the first four years of life. When liquid versions are unavailable, some pills cannot be crushed and mixed in juice; they must be swallowed whole.In contrast, Quadrimune contains four HIV drugs: ritonavir, lopinavir, abacavir and lamivudine. The granules are coated first in a polymer that does not melt until it reaches the stomach, and then with sweet, fruity flavoring.Dr. Kogie Naidoo, who heads treatment research at Caprisa, an AIDS treatment and research group based in Durban, South Africa, who was not involved in Quadrimune&#39;s development, said the new formulation could solve many problems she and her colleagues encounter while treating children.Cipla, founded in 1935, was the first generic drug company to offer HIV drugs in Africa. In 2001, its chairman, Yusuf K. Hamied, upended the global pharmaceutical industry by offering to supply a three-drug combination to Doctors Without Borders for $1 a day.At the time, multinational drug companies were charging up to $15,000 for their regimens and refusing to lower prices except in secret negotiations with a few countries and were working to block generic competitors from the market. An estimated 25 million Africans were then infected and thousands were dying every day. (The industry was also suing South Africa&#39;s president, Nelson Mandela, over a law he had signed authorizing the government to cancel drug patents and award them to generic-makers.)In 2001, Hamied said he was losing money at the $350 a year price; his break-even point was $600, he said, and he offered it to other buyers for that.But he said he acceded to requests from AIDS activists for the $1 a day price to deliver a shock to his Western competitors and because such a nice round figure was likely to make headlines (a gambit he is clearly repeating now).In the decades since, increased generic competition has driven the price of triple therapy in poor countries to below $100 a year.&quot;Over the past 20 years, Cipla has pioneered fixed-dose combinations for children and I do believe our Quadrimune could be a winner,&quot; Hamied said in an interview this week.Because all four drugs in the formulation are older and no longer patented, Cipla might eventually offer it in wealthy countries too, he said. But that market is quite small because most pregnant women in the West are tested for HIV and immediately put on antiretroviral drugs, which reduces to near zero the chances that they will infect their babies in the womb, during birth or through breastfeeding.The $1 a day price is for Quadrimune doses appropriate for children of between 20 and 30 pounds, he noted, so the cost for newborns would be even lower.Paradoxically, treating infants with HIV has actually become harder in recent years than it was two decades ago.In the early 2000s, Cipla produced Triomune Baby and Triomune Junior, two pediatric formulations of the world&#39;s first adult three-in-one pill, introduced in 2001.But they contained nevirapine, a drug that in those days was often given to pregnant women to prevent mother-child transmission. As a result, many babies were born with nevirapine-resistant forms of the virus, and the efficacy of pediatric Triomune fell by about half, Pecoul said.Some nevirapine substitutes that work in adults do not work well in children and the combination that does work has the bitter taste.Nowadays, many pediatric HIV specialists are frustrated that they cannot prescribe some of the newest drugs, such as tenofovir and dolutegravir, because there is little or no data on how safe they are in small children. The major drugmakers have little incentive to test their products in children because there are so few customers who can pay high prices.If a child&#39;s virus develops resistance to any regimen, a new one must be tried, so more research is needed, said Naidoo, the AIDS researcher in Durban.But by any measure, she said, Cipla&#39;s new, gentler formulation for children is a major advance: &quot;This is indeed great news for treating pediatric HIV.&quot;This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company","description":"About 80,000 babies and toddlers die of AIDS each year, mostly in Africa, in part because their medicines come in hard pills or bitter syrups that are very difficult for small children to swallow or keep down.But on Friday, the Indian generic drug manufacturer Cipla announced a new, more palatable pediatric formulation.

Here&#39;s everything you need to know:How did modern Ukraine emerge?  Ukraine&#39;s history is intertwined with Russia&#39;s. Both cultures descend from the medieval Slavic empire Kievan Rus, founded by Vikings in the 9th century with a capital where Kyiv stands today. After the empire was overrun by Mongol invaders in the 13th century, the Rus leadership moved northeastward, to a small trading outpost called Moscow. The lands around Kyiv were carved up by competing powers, who prized the fertile plains and rich, dark soil that later earned Ukraine the nickname &quot;the breadbasket of Europe.&quot; Poland and Lithuania dominated the country for hundreds of years, but by the end of the 18th century, the Russian Empire had taken the eastern lands, while the western were controlled by the Austro-Hungarian Empire -- a division that resonates to this day. Both empires collapsed at the end of World War I, and in 1917 a Ukrainian state was declared, but it was quickly swallowed by the communist Soviet Union. It was only in 1991, after the Soviet Union dissolved, that the modern borders of Ukraine were established. Russia has never really accepted Ukraine&#39;s independence, and Ukraine has been careening between pro-Western and pro-Russian leaders ever since.Why do Russians still see it as theirs?  The cultural and Orthodox religious ties between the two peoples go back centuries. But perhaps more importantly, Russia has no natural mountain or river borders to protect its western front, and it has long seen Ukraine as a vital strategic buffer. &quot;Russia without Ukraine is a country,&quot; explains Daniel Drezner, an international politics professor at Tufts University. &quot;Russia with Ukraine is an empire.&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin wants at all costs to keep Ukraine out of the European Union and NATO, and he has used Ukraine&#39;s dependence on Russian natural gas as a weapon -- cutting off supplies in 2006 as Ukrainians froze in the winter cold. Ukraine is bitterly divided between Ukrainian speakers in the west, who mostly want to align their country with the West, and Russian speakers in the east.Why did the U.S. get involved?  Since 1991, the U.S. has sought to guarantee Ukraine&#39;s independence and security, seeing it as a key bridge between East and West. When the USSR dissolved, Ukraine inherited the third-largest nuclear arsenal in the world, with some 1,900 strategic nuclear weapons pointed at the United States. Keen to avoid a proliferation of nuclear powers, the U.S., U.K., and Russia in 1994 signed the Budapest Memorandum, which transferred the weapons to Russia in exchange for a commitment by Washington, Moscow, and London to &quot;respect the independence and sovereignty and existing borders of Ukraine&quot; and to &quot;refrain from the threat or use of force&quot; against it. Russia continued meddling in Ukrainian politics, though, and overtly broke the treaty in 2014.What did Russia do?  Ukraine&#39;s 2004 election was a showdown between pro-Western Viktor Yushchenko and pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych. During the campaign, Yushchenko was disfigured by dioxin poisoning widely attributed to Russia, and after the vote was rigged for Yanukovych, Ukrainians rose up in the Orange Revolution, which culminated in a revote and a victory for Yushchenko. In the 2010 election, though, Yanukovych came roaring back to win the presidency with the help of both Russia and American political consultant Paul Manafort. In 2013, Moscow forced Yanukovych to cancel the country&#39;s bid to move closer to the EU, leading to an uprising that forced Yanukovych out. In the tumult that ensued, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea and later sent troops into Ukraine&#39;s eastern regions to start a separatist war. The Obama administration punished Russia with sanctions, but chose not to send weapons to Ukraine out of fear of triggering a larger war.How is the war going?   Armed by Russia and supported by Russian paramilitaries, two ­Russian-­speaking Ukrain­ian regions collectively called the Donbass declared independence in 2014 and have been fighting with Ukraine ever since. An estimated 13,000 people have been killed and some 1.5 million displaced. In 2018, then-­national security adviser H.R. McMaster and other aides persuaded a reluctant Pres­i­dent Trump to send $400 million in military aid to Kyiv, including counter-artillery radar systems and Javelin anti-tank missiles. Without that aid, Mariya Omelicheva of the Pen­ta­gon&#39;s Nation­al De­fense Uni­ver­si­ty told The Atlan­tic, the 300-mile-long front line in the eastern Don­bass region &quot;would have been moved further west into Ukraine, and ­Russia-backed rebels would have controlled more Ukrain­ian territory.&quot; That&#39;s why the possibility of U.S. aid being held up -- the subject of the impeachment ­inquiry -- is so important to Ukraine. Ukraine&#39;s new president, Volody­myr Zelen­sky, finds himself caught in a struggle between Democrats and Trump -- who has reportedly been echoing Vladimir Putin&#39;s claim that Ukraine is corrupt and &quot;not a real country.&quot;Americans cash in  As Ukraine emerged from communism and struggled to build a rule-of-law economy, politically connected Amer­i­cans saw ways to make money. Paul Mana­fort, President Trump&#39;s former campaign manager, earned at least $13 million -- and possibly much more -- ­working for pro-­Russian Ukrainian oligarchs. His consultancy for a pro-Russian party that tried to undermine the U.S. alliance with Ukraine was crucial to the triumph of Yanu­ko­vych in the 2010 election. Mana­fort is now serving 7½ years in prison for tax fraud over those earnings. Joe Biden&#39;s son Hunter joined the board of Buris­ma, a Ukrain­ian gas company, in 2014 at a reported salary of tens of thousands of dollars a month, although there is no indication that either Biden broke any laws.

She samples old-world delights at a hole-in-the-wall bakery, and tastes what looks to be pistachio ice cream at a bustling market, or “souk” as it’s known in Damascus. Curious young boys surround her, an attraction in her own right—a tourist in a country better known for producing refugees. “It’s too much,” she exclaims, a keffiyeh in the style of the Syrian flag draped around her neck.Eva, who graduated from Oxford before working as a social media professional at a media startup in London, wasn’t in Syria to do journalism, work for the United Nations, or—in a break from past visitors—express solidarity with Bashar al-Assad, whose regime responded to a mass uprising in 2011 by releasing terrorists, shooting civilians, and burning the country. No, she’s an oddity in a country still very much at war: a tourist, one of several adventure-seekers with a high-profile presence on YouTube and Instagram who have recently gone on excursions in this blood-soaked part of the Levant.“I have been to other places that, potentially, you could say have ‘viral potential’ or whatever you want to call it,” Eva told The Daily Beast. Iran. Iraqi Kurdistan. But, when going far off the beaten path, for a Western travel blogger, she said the motive isn’t money. “I went to Syria because I am personally interested in the country,” having met Syrians who told her about a homeland they themselves cannot visit, she said, “not because I was thinking about [YouTube] views or anything like that.”Such a trip would not be unusual in 2010, when 8.5 million tourists reportedly visited Syria. “Discover wonderful old Damascene houses, admire the mesmerizing gold mosaics of Umayyad Mosque, or savour the silence of the Palmyra ruins,” states a travel guide from Lonely Planet, last updated more than a decade ago. A lot has happened in that time. For one, there are now more ruins.At least 400,000 people had been killed as of April 2016, when the United Nations stopped counting; a month before, the international governing body accused the Syrian government of carrying out a policy of terror—of barrel bombs, sarin and chlorine gas—that amounts to the crime of “extermination.” Many of the 259,000 people who worked in tourism in 2010, according to the Syrian government, are dead or in exile; all had to find other work.Khaldoun Al-Alamy, 53, never left Damascus and is now in a position to benefit from the fact others are, slowly, coming back. From the start of the year until the end of August 2019, a spokesperson for the Syrian Ministry of Tourism said 1.5 million people visited the country, up 61 percent from the same period a year before. Al-Alamy runs a travel agency, Golden Target Tours, and he’s the one who arranged Eva’s trip. He told me he’s been fielding a slew of inquiries since she gave him a shout out, online.Hosn Castle, also known as Krak des Chevaliers.Mohamed AzakirOver the phone, he gave the same pitch he’s been desperately giving the last few years about Syria’s historical sites and friendly people, when his career became more a passion. “You can visit the biggest mosque in the area, the bazaar, the oldest church, old houses, everything,” he said. There’s an ancient Roman amphitheater, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, south of the capital in Bosra, and a medieval castle, Krak des Chevaliers, up north, near the border with Lebanon. His most popular tour, however, is for three nights in the capital. This, he said, has been his best year since war destroyed whatever business he had.“When you see the people coming and visiting and shopping, and the restaurants are all full,” he said between fits of coughing, “that gives you a really very nice, very positive feeling. You feel like life is returning. Life is normal. That there’s a future.”Tourists began returning in larger numbers after the Syrian regime crushed what was left of the armed resistance in Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, and Daraa, a province just south of the capital and considered by many to be the seat of the revolution. In early 2011, schoolchildren there were arrested over anti-regime graffiti—for telling “the doctor,” their opthamologist turned dictator, that he would be next to fall in the Arab Spring. One was subsequently tortured to death, the return of their 13-year-old body causing the town to erupt in protest, believing a better world was possible. In Syria, at least, it wasn’t, the world watching as the doctor set the country ablaze.* * *Today’s visitors are different than those who came before the war, when Syria was repressed but enjoying a false peace. “Most of them are young people, educated,” al-Alamy told me. “This is very important, because those people will be our ambassadors, let’s say, outside,” he said. And most are happy to fill that role; to boast of their adventures in a place that’s been barrel-bombed off the map of most other travelers.In Damascus, what’s long been a police state has long since been militarized. “There’s a checkpoint on every corner,” Joan Townsend Torres, a 31-year-old Spaniard who visited in 2018 and has authored a guide for those who wish to follow in his footsteps. And there are other military installations, he recalled, that make traditional tourist activities, like snapping photos of everything, a bit more risky, especially in a locale that associates photography with journalism—with subversion.“I always walk around with my big camera hanging from my shoulder,” Joan told me. And he had a number of conversations with soldiers asking him what he was up to, and insisting on a review of his photos. Most people, he said, are just happy to learn he’s not a reporter; that he’s a tourist, instead, “means that the country’s changing.”Outside the country, Joan said, the response is different.“You receive a lot of emails and messages from people… [who] are really, really angry that [someone] went to Syria because it’s, like, supporting the government and it’s unethical,” Joan acknowledged. Still, “I don’t think there’s anything bad about it. I mean, I didn’t take selfies with destroyed buildings behind me.”The actual number of visitors cannot be independently verified, and one tour operator in Damascus, “Ayoub,” requesting anonymity as “the situation is very sensitive,” said the government’s figures are almost certainly inflated, counting anyone who crosses the border, for any reason, as a “tourist.” But more are in fact coming. Excluding Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan, just under 142,000 foreigners officially stepped foot in Syria during the first two-thirds of 2019, according to the Ministry of Tourism, up 17 percent from the year before.“We don’t have a lot of tourists,” the tour operator in Damascus noted. “But now we have more.”Before the conflict, it was, generally, history—those ancient ruins in Palmyra, since desecrated by ISIS—that brought the tour groups. And history, generally, attracts an older crowd. During the height of the war, when rebel mortars still threatened neighborhoods in Damascus, visitors still came, but in solidarity: fascists who see allies in Baathism; anti-imperialists who see the leading contributor to violence in Syria, Bashar al-Assad, as a victim of a failed international conspiracy to forcibly change his regime.A general view shows ruins in the historic city of Palmyra, Syria March 4, 2017.Omar Sanadiki“The main reason for tourism now, it’s just, like, to show off, you know?” the Damascus tour operator told me. It’s a younger, more online set, eager to “show off on the social media to get some followers [and] a lot of likes.”It’s not inherently evil, that. Who doesn’t want to be liked? Nor is it fair to say those who go to Syria have not grappled with the ethics of that decision; they have ultimately decided it is okay, of course, but they are not oblivious. The question is really whether Syria is exceptional — that is, while visitors insist they are not doing politics, is it possible not to? Or, as some maintain, is it really no different than visiting anywhere else in the world with a less than stellar head of state? There is a difference, of course: almost nowhere is as bad as Syria, a condemnation of its regime more than absolution for any other. And there are millions in a diaspora who cannot do what a white tourist can: step foot in their homeland. On an emotional level, the tourists I interviewed understood this, even if they ultimately rejected the logic for boycotting travel to Syria. It’s not lost on their tour operators, either.“Yeah, I know this,” the Damascus tour operator confessed, after a pregnant silence, when I asked if he could understand some Syrians’ anger toward the mostly European tourists who purchase his services. “I lost my home during the war,” he said, and “a lot of my friends” are now abroad, most in Germany. They cannot enter regime-held Syria, suspected of opposition sympathies or wanted for military service—or subject to arrest just for leaving the country without permission.Native-born Germans, on the other hand: “When they start seeing the refugees, they get more curious to go to that country to see where these people came from,” he said. “They meet a Syrian and they start talking and they [the Syrian] tell them, like, ‘I wish I could go back to my country.’” And so they, the Germans, visit on their behalf “and bring him something from the ground.”Others, on the “influencer” end of the spectrum, can sometimes be less admirable, treating the source of so much pain in this young and brutal 21st century as a playground—another stop on a social media tour, with an expectation that with Insta-fame comes generosity, toward them. One, the operator said, “chose to arrive here on Ramadan, because they give a lot of [free] meals. And she stayed on CouchSurfing with a Syrian girl. And so she traveled without spending any money.”He himself would like to travel to Italy someday, but that would cost something far beyond the means of most Syrians; they are lucky to make $100 a month these days, down from $1,000 before the war, or what most in government-controlled areas term “the conflict,” so as to not suggest parity between sides. And so this tour operator, in school to become the sort of licensed guide to this police state’s foreign visitors, has never been a tourist himself. “I grew up during the war,” he explained. “I didn’t have a chance.”Most refugees are destitute, and while some who stayed behind were able to do so thanks to their wealth and power, not fearing arbitrary arrest or worse, many others lacked the means to head somewhere not at war. And it’s too late now. In an age of militarized borders, where the hypocrisies of liberal internationalism have given way to the open malice of right-wing authoritarianism, where would they go? Doors are closing, and many of those who did make it out can never return in the absence of a change in regime. Those who can safely visit Syria are those with no public record of criticizing the government, or any demonstrable ties to those who have. A wrong bet—a mistaken faith in Damascus’ haphazard talk of reconciliation—can result in one disappearing in a torture chamber like Sednaya, a prison where “Syrian authorities have quietly and methodically organized the killing of thousands of people in their custody,” according to Amnesty International. A correct assessment of the risk, however, can also lead one to sip wine and post selfies to Instagram just outside that detention center, like Russian state propagandists and French fascists, such guests of honor spared the need for a regime minder.The contradiction between sight-seeing and immense human suffering is not lost on all who come. After the normalcy of Damascus, Eva visited Aleppo to see ruins that weren’t on any tourist’s agenda prior to 2011. Her tone, as she walks among the half of the city once occupied by rebels, and destroyed by the government, is markedly different: “This isn’t fun,” would be any viewer’s takeaway.“I just felt, frankly, quite saddened by the whole situation,” Eva told me later, speaking as she walked the streets of her latest stop, Mexico City. “And I think it is absolutely tragic that people who are from the country cannot come back.” She’s been to other politically fraught destinations, including Iran and Yemen. But her pre-war interest in Syria, she said, was renewed by a flight from Dubai. The man in the seat next to her was originally from Syria, and unable to return. “You can probably go as a foreigner,” she recalls him saying. “Just, if you go, can you please just kiss Aleppo for me?”“I think that Syria is a destination that you can only visit if you’re prepared to be uncomfortable,” Eva told me, “and potentially be in a situation that is not safe—and be prepared to be extremely sensitive,” said, “because this is not a beach in Thailand.”The Syrian government has, in its haphazard way, promoted the idea that it kind of is, though. On its YouTube channel, the Syrian Ministry of Tourism posts footage of young people in bikinis enjoying the emerald waters off the coast of Latakia; amid the 2016 siege of Aleppo, Syrian state media published video boasting of the “thriving nightlife” in the government-held Western half of the city.Tourists who visit tend to highlight the same things as the regime’s propagandists: the good, not the bad. This isn’t because most are shills for a government that is largely responsible for the worst bloodshed most of us have seen in our lifetime. It’s the limits of the genre: travel bloggers are not journalists, and travel blogging is not journalism.But isn’t it, really? Going to a foreign land and reporting back on what you saw is awfully close to what someone called a “reporter” would do. In this age of mass media layoffs, however, the role of the professional is increasingly filled by independent amateurs. That the Syrian state allows in the latter may not be an explicit propaganda strategy, but that some tourists are active and influential on social media—and uninterested in politicizing their experience or explaining who killed who, if they even know enough to speculate—is undoubtedly a service to the cause of normalizing a rogue, murderous state.Eva is no apologist for tyranny in Syria anymore than she, by visiting the United States, is a de facto supporter of Donald Trump. She is, again, a travel blogger eager to describe her excursions, which often take her to places with complex political realities on which she does not opine. Indeed, when it comes to politics and travel, “I don’t know [that] there’s a relation between those two things,” she told me.Perhaps it is unfair to expect sophisticated political analysis from a tourist on a short excursion; perhaps, in fact, it is better that they refrain and save us and them the embarrassment of a half-baked perspective, informed by taxi drivers and Wikipedia. But its absence speaks, too.I, for one, was initially unfair toward Eva, answering her video from Damascus with social media posts of my own, thinking her engaged in propaganda, conscious or not. How ghoulish, I maintained, to omit the war—to assert from the start that this elephant would not be discussed—while celebrating a capital, bloated by the internally displaced from wrecked suburbs, as a tourist destination like any other. But in her eyes, and in her approach, that is exactly what it was and remains: a place on Earth, unique, with beautiful sites, friendly people and messy politics.* * *Syria isn’t really like any other place, though. More than half its population has been displaced. Activists aren’t just spied on and harassed by police, but tortured and killed—just blocks away from where you, the useful traveler, may have raved about the dessert.If something is perceived as propaganda, does it matter then if that was not the intent? If it’s unthinking, that may just mean it’s more effective.“I mean, I don’t think it’s possible to be apolitical in this context!” said Yasmin Fedda, a filmmaker whose 2012 documentary, A Tale of Two Syrias, explored the lives of pre-war Damascenes, and the brutality and hardship that precipitated an uprising. “It’s very naive to think so and shows a lack of understanding.”Fedda is one of nearly 100 Syrian filmmakers who signed an October 14 open letter signed by decrying the “increasingly common” practice of regime-approved, foreign directors using unreconstructed war zones in their productions. “These devastated towns and cities [are] transformed into cinematic backdrops,” they wrote, the scene of war crimes and forced displacement “used as movie sets for regime-sponsored films.”Tourists may be subject to less intensive vetting, but they are welcomed for the same reason: to be, as the tour operator al-Alamy said, “ambassadors”—to promote a positive image of the country abroad; to do what travel bloggers do everywhere they go: present their experiences in a generally pleasant light that makes others want to do the same, and a touch jealous that they haven’t already.Kristyan Benedict, a campaigner at Amnesty International, thinks likewise. “Any organised tourism will almost certainly be controlled by the Assad regime, which will seek to profit from it financially while using it as a PR tool as part of its campaign to claim Syria is back to normal,” he told me. At the same time, “Tourists who venture into Syria should be aware of the very grave risks—including kidnapping and car bombs—and be prepared to massively self-censor or risk falling foul of Assad’s intelligence forces,” he told me. Going at all, he argued, is to lend credibility to a regime eager to use foreign visitors “as a PR tool in its campaign to claim Syria is back to normal.”But after eight years of war, that is also what many Syrians desire: a return, if not to “normal,” to the mundane, everyday repression of a hereditary dictatorship—less cruel, while perversely brutal, if only because it was more confident. A false peace is, at the end of a civil war, preferable to death.* * *Jamila, a 20-something who works as a translator in Damascus, has long been enchanted by the world outside of her own troubled slice of it. She’s never been beyond Lebanon, lacking the opportunity and the money to go any further, but some years back she joined Couchsurfing, a networking website for international travelers. Typically, as the name may suggest, it works like this: tourists find locals willing to put them up, and then they sleep on their couch. Damascus has almost 1,900 such “hosts,” according to the site, but hosting a foreigner in Syria is risky business: it’s not really legal.“I didn’t know it was dangerous,” Jamila told me over the phone. She signed up as a teenager, looking to meet people from abroad and practice her English. But she has never actually hosted a traveler; inviting a stranger into your home may be a typical act of Syrian hospitality, but letting them sleep there? Until the suburbs of Damascus were subdued, Jamila said military patrols would go door to door, demanding to see each household’s “family book”—a ledger of inhabitants registered with the state. Anyone not on the page, but inside the house, could be perceived as a draft dodger or a terrorist, which is to say a member of the opposition. So, instead of letting anyone surf her couch, Jamila has used the site as a social network, offering foreigners advice on what to see and do, and meeting up with them when they arrive.That can be dangerous too. Who are these people? Until recently, such visitors would be journalists who, if perceived as critical, would be subject to all the surveillance a police state can muster. And while paranoia has lessened somewhat, there are stories Jamila shared about such encounters that cannot be published without risking her liberty, even with the relative freedom of anonymity.You needn’t do anything wrong to end up in trouble with the Syrian authorities. Someone further up in the hierarchy of power could decide to haul you in for an interrogation, because that foreigner you spoke to could be perceived as a spy, or a journalist, or they just might need someone to blame for a screw up—someone being allowed into the country that shouldn’t have been, sometimes just in hindsight—who isn’t further up than them.Tour operators can’t take any chances; running afoul of the state could mean, at best, no more visas for your customers. For that reason they can’t just rely on the government’s background check when considering whether to admit a traveler; they scour social media, from LinkedIn to Instagram, to ensure that Western influencer isn’t actually a Western journalist. “I Google the name,” said Ayoub, the Damascus tour operator, “because if I discover that you work with international organizations, or journalists—especially the journalists—and they have not discovered this in the Department of Immigration, when trouble happens I’m going to be responsible.”It’s happened before. All the tour operators I spoke to, and most of the tourists, were familiar with a story from late 2018, which changed everything—or at least made explicit who would be blamed for a heavy-handed police state doing what heavy-handed police states do. A young German tourist, in some tellings a “journalist,” was taking photos on the outskirts of Damascus. While it might be okay to take photos of some damage, and impossible not to encounter it on one’s journey, entire suburbs have been decimated during the course of the war—and access to them highly curtailed, for propaganda purposes. “I was the tourist who encountered significant problems, and thought an explanation was in order,” Felix Mechnig-Giordano, posted to the private Facebook group, Every Passport Stamp. “While walking around Damascus I came across one of the destroyed suburbs and asked a soldier if it was possible for me to enter,” he wrote. “While no one was concerned at first, this ended up with me being blindfolded, handcuffed and thrown into a secret police van.” He spent the next five days in a military prison at the Mezze military base, where leaked photos from a regime defector show that thousands have been executed since 2011, just a few miles from bars and restaurants.“At some point, someone had accused me of being a spy,” Mechnig-Giordano wrote. The interrogation soon revealed that to be untrue, but that is not what saved him: his nationality did. “[I]t demonstrated how vulnerable foreign visitors remain to arbitrary detention, and that at basically any opportunity anyone can accuse [anyone] of pretty much anything, leading to arrest and worst.” And, he continued, “While my German passport protected me from any sort of physical harm, the same could not be said for the hundreds of Syrians I saw being held and tortured. As the secret police so loved reminding me, you are pretty much screwed and at their mercy with no possibility of consular assistance once you are detained.”His travel agent fled the country, which didn’t help appearances. After that incident, an unspoken rule became an explicit requirement that all Western tourists—shorthand for about everyone outside Syria’s immediate neighbors—be accompanied by a guide at all times. These are not government agents, but they serve a purpose: keeping an eye on the guests and steering them and their interlocutors away from the problematic.But the sanitized version of Syria on display in some content is not the product of state censorship nor of malice on the creator’s part. It’s the form; these are vacation highlights, accenting the virtues of a destination and its people. And there is an argument for not letting 18 million people be defined solely by their relationship to a hereditary war criminal.“When we hear ‘Syria,’ we tend to think of all the negative things we’ve been hearing in the news, on TV,” Stefan Gentsch says in one of his YouTube videos. A 33-year-old travel blogger who resides in Singapore, he visited Damascus for the first time in late 2018, his visa sponsored by an old friend. His experience, as presented online, is a rejoinder of sorts—to the idea that Syria is defined only by its war and its dictator. His videos showcase the Syrian people’s legendary hospitality (most people think he’s Russian), and in one he travels outside Damascus to a town called Maaraba, which is unlikely to be on anyone else’s itinerary. There he tours a bread factory and gets invited to a wedding where he is peer-pressured into dancing.“Being in Syria, being at this wedding, I witnessed something that even before my trip, I might not have imagined Syria to be like. People dancing and enjoying themselves… It’s such a contrast to what think of as Syria.”He had a good time, and there’s a powerful argument that human beings should not be divided by borders, or cede the inalienable right to cultural exchange because crossing a line on a map might be perceived as a political act.But it’s what Stefan told me over the phone about his trip to Maaraba that I found most interesting: an omission, not the product of malice, that might have altered the viewer’s perception of Syria, and bolstered the latter’s infamy as a bastion of arbitrary oppression. He was detained—by police or the military he isn’t sure. “I did get in a little bit of trouble,” he told me. His Syrian friend, and visa sponsor, walked into a shop in Maraaba, a town, held by rebels until early 2018, where tour operators I asked said no tourist should be (“Tourists go to the touristic sites. Why are you going to empty places?” an alarmed al-Alamy said. “You are putting yourself in a bad position.”). As his friend was shopping, Stefan was on the street, snapping photos of nothing in particular, as tourists do. That’s when a man in uniform approached him speaking Arabic, a language he did not understand. Still, he got the gist. “He didn’t like that I had taken a picture.” And so the officer took him to a station, where was detained for a couple hours. “I was just sitting there, smiling,” he said. “I was not concerned about ending up in prison. My concern, or my biggest concern, was that maybe my phone will be confiscated and I would lose all the pictures I had taken on the trip.” While it was what led to his detention, &quot;there&#39;s nothing special about the photo, it&#39;s an ordinary photo on the street to Maaraba,&quot; said Gentsch.Stefan GentschThere is no video of the incident, which ended with a superior, upon concluding that he was not in fact a spy or a one-man ISIS splinter cell, saying he could take all the photos he wants (“You’re a tourist!”). Accordingly, it is not on YouTube, and the impression, thus, is one of a country not quite as totalitarian as it was in reality. It is not propaganda, by any means. Still, Stefan told me he’s noticed his content being exploited by partisans who comment on his videos. “They might say something like, ‘Oh, if a German tourist can go to Syria, then why do Syrian refugees have to be let into Europe?’” And supporters of the Syrian regime—there is some crossover—will say “Assad is the greatest, he made this beautiful country safe again.”There are Assad’s opponents, too. They’ll say, “How can you report about how beautiful your experience was in Damascus, when 100,000 people have died under Assad’s rule?” Stefan said. It is a question he thought about. “The conclusion that I always tend to reach whenever I think about is that I’m traveling as a tourist, I know I do, and I don’t have any political motivation,” he told me. “I’m simply there to walk onto the streets to talk to everyday people, and to see what life is like.” Some do, however, intend to challenge the prevailing narrative on Syria—not just by humanizing people typically relegated to the status of voiceless bystander, or by simply leaving out an unpleasant encounter. Some are more consciously political, even if they still lean more tourist than activist. “Sitting in Damascus, having a beer, you had jet flights flying over head, fighting in the suburbs,” said Christian Lindgren, a 31-year-old Norwegian who visited in 2017. “There were no tourists in the country whatsoever.” The next year, when he returned following the regime’s military conquest of the suburbs, “it was much, much calmer. Like being in a different country.”But it still has its rules, like any other. Christian noted what happened to Felix, whom he described as a friend he met through travel forums online. “Wrong place at the wrong time,” is how he described his friend’s detention. “When you go there, any war zone with a lot of military and police, there’s places you shouldn’t take pictures of. It’s that simple.”But you should still try to visit. “When you go there, you’ll never trust Western media again,” he insisted. Indeed, his blog on his latest trip insists “there’s far less destruction in Aleppo than what the media has been telling us.” And there is, despite the tight controls on where one can visit and what one can do there, a sort of freedom, if only perceived: “I was granted full access,” he maintained. “I was even allowed to visit a school that Desh (ISIS) and al Qaeda used as headquarters.” (ISIS and al Qaeda were bitter opponents, and the former did not have a significant presence in rebel-held Aleppo).When I asked how he could be so sure he was getting the straight news in one of the most dangerous countries to be a journalist, he told me a rule he’s picked up in his travels. “Go to a bar, have a few drinks with the locals, and you’ll really get an honest answer,” he said. “In any country in the world, it’s the same.” “I’ve gone to so many places that seemed dangerous, in the media,” Christian explained, “and I’ve gotten so much criticism for it. But none of those people that gave criticisms have been to those places.”* * *Sarah Hunaidi has been to Syria. She lived there until 2014; like millions of others, she was forced to flee her home over the crime of opposing state-sanctioned murder. She does not necessarily oppose others doing what she cannot—set foot in the place she called home—but she does think that with privilege comes certain responsibilities.“Touring Syria and meeting Syrian people and buying goods to benefit them is one thing,” Hunaidi told me, “and taking vlogs and video and ‘reporting’ about ‘the truth’ is another.” The main difference between an ethical tourist and, frankly, an asshole, is conscientiousness—being aware of where, exactly, you are. “By existing in a war zone, you are part of the war,” she told me. And one can’t avoid politics when your being there, while journalists and refugees cannot, as approving of your presence was itself a political decision by those who started that war.Shiyam Ghalyon is a Syrian-American who works for the War Resisters League, an anti-imperialist organization in New York City. Her sin, in the eyes of Damascus, is being too consistent—opposing war crimes in Syria, no matter the party that carried them out. That means, primarily, condemning the leading perpetrator of violence since 2011: the government that stamps the passports. And that means, in turn, accepting that she cannot step foot in any territory that government controls.“I do not have a blanket opposition to go to Syria, but I do think it should be a requirement to be very purposeful and intentional,” Ghalyon said. “In general, one should be thoughtful of how they move between local communities—but especially when the local communities are experiencing severe and systemic government brutality.”Many travelers are thoughtful (some a good deal more than others) and do express a conscious familiarity with where they are from, the privilege that affords them, and where they have been: a devastated country full of traumatized people who could go to jail, or worse, if they were to provide a complete stranger, from abroad, a truly authentic experience in Syria. Self-censorship is not an allegation, but a fact of life, awareness of which is the prerequisite sought by many in the Syrian diaspora.“I never brought up the subject of politics,” said Joan, the Spanish travel blogger. He has a business relationship with a local tour operator, to whom he refers prospective visitors; he isn’t naive when it comes to where he’s sending them, and why the people there may offer a gentler-than-mainstream take on the head of their police state. “Usually, most people would say that they like Bashar al-Assad,” Joan recounted, “but I mean, there’s a very simple reason: the people who don’t like him are either dead or they escaped from the country.”In fact, he told me, Syria is a bit like Spain—“when we were under military dictatorship, led by Franco,” who, like Bashar’s father, ruled until death, after killing tens of thousands. In Franco’s Spain as in Assad’s Syria, it would be wrong to confuse post-war resignation with anything more than a desire to return to something approaching normal.“I mean, regardless of whether he’s a murderer or not, he brought now stability to the country, right? It was a civil war going on. And he won. And now, finally, he’s rolling,” Joan said.* * *There’s a thin line between exposure and exploitation. Traveling to a war-torn nation and posting footage of the destruction could raise awareness, or it could be an exercise in showcasing the traveler’s superior empathy—crass, superficial and gross. It’s a delicate balance that some avoid by omitting the war altogether. By focusing on the positive amid the rubble, though, one runs the risk of the same offense: failing to capture the gravity of the situation. Is it actually more perverse to carry on as if nothing is wrong?Xavier Raychell Blancharde, a British-Polish college student who visited Syria as an 18-year-old, stressed that when I asked about the upcoming tour he’s arranging. For $1,300, tourists can accompany him on a January 2020 trip to Damascus, Maaloula, Krak de Chevaliers and Bosra al Sham, a Roman amphitheater recently re-opened to tourism. “I’ve been to Syria twice now,” he told me. “While we will certainly not attempt to hide the tragedy that has taken place in the country, we will also not specifically be heading to destroyed neighborhoods as a tourist group, for I personally find this extremely disrespectful and immoral. It is not ‘war tourism.’”In a video on a recent trip to coastal Latakia—which comes with the disclaimer that it “is NOT intended to be political”—he too compared the nation to Spain. But, again, it wasn’t political, at least not overtly. “The landscape is really similar, I think, to some places I’ve been to in southern Spain. And I think very few people would actually imagine that this is Syria…. People have a stereotyped image of the place, and this just completely breaks down that stereotype,” he said.That Syria has beautiful places cannot be denied. Focusing on that may be a travel blogger’s purview, but it is also no doubt a coup for the regime whenever natural beauty, and not human-wrought destruction, is the focus of a Westerner’s piece of content.Jamila, the Syrian Couchsurfer, said most visitors don’t try to get into matters of death and punishment. “They all know that we cannot speak a lot about politics. They would just maybe comment, ‘We didn’t know people loved your president.’ These would be the comments. But they wouldn’t ask too much.”That many in the Syrian diaspora object to tourists taking selfies in Damascus (with rubble or otherwise) is understandable, to her, but she welcomes these visitors, and is happy more than just reporters are showing up these days. “I understand them completely,” she said. “They think of tourists coming back as funding the government and they are against the government. They would say you’re helping the government kill the Syrian people.”Still, she argued, “most Syrians who live in Syria want tourists, and most people who don’t live in Syria don’t want tourists” At the very least, it’s good for the economy. “Our life is not even the minimum life,” she told me. “We are like really, really poor. Everyone here is really poor. Tourism would benefit people who are living here.” And, she said, “Whether we like it or not, the government did win.”But most of those Syrians outside the country couldn’t come back, even if they didn’t already object to foreigners touring their former home. Syrians who left the country are inherently suspect. Why would you go? And according to the Syrian Association for Citizens’ Dignity, two-thirds of those who have returned, to live if not to visit, say either they or a relative are wanted for arrest by the regime, which remains hungry for conscripts to fight in a country very much at war. Most, overwhelmingly, regret their decision to return. Others could not be asked: since coming back they have disappeared. It’s the insensitive traveler who Jamila wishes would avoid her country. “I think there’s a type where they see us Syrians as aliens, as just like their little research project,” she told me. She had one white guy in mind. “He treats our misery as an experience. He treats our war, and the things we’ve been going through, as a thrilling experience.” And this type also believes a holiday can be a fact-finding mission. In truth, “We cannot speak a lot about politics, and if we spoke we’re not going to say everything we’re thinking about, because we’re not free to say whatever we want.”So don’t do that, if you go. Don’t expect your eyes and ears will always receive the truth; sometimes the ground can obstruct the senses. And know one thing: whatever your troubles, you are the lucky, privileged one in every interaction. Maybe that, more than any expose beyond the paygrade of the amateur or uninitiated, is what any traveler to Syria has a responsibility to convey. If you go, in other words, speak the truths that might prevent you from ever going back. Syrians could relate to that.“Syria is safe for foreigners, 100 percent, and yes, come please and support us because we need every single penny,” Jamila told me. “But,” she stressed, “it is not safe for Syrians.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

She samples old-world delights at a hole-in-the-wall bakery, and tastes what looks to be pistachio ice cream at a bustling market, or “souk” as it’s known in Damascus. Curious young boys surround her, an attraction in her own right—a tourist in a country better known for producing refugees. “It’s too much,” she exclaims, a keffiyeh in the style of the Syrian flag draped around her neck.Eva, who graduated from Oxford before working as a social media professional at a media startup in London, wasn’t in Syria to do journalism, work for the United Nations, or—in a break from past visitors—express solidarity with Bashar al-Assad, whose regime responded to a mass uprising in 2011 by releasing terrorists, shooting civilians, and burning the country. No, she’s an oddity in a country still very much at war: a tourist, one of several adventure-seekers with a high-profile presence on YouTube and Instagram who have recently gone on excursions in this blood-soaked part of the Levant.“I have been to other places that, potentially, you could say have ‘viral potential’ or whatever you want to call it,” Eva told The Daily Beast. Iran. Iraqi Kurdistan. But, when going far off the beaten path, for a Western travel blogger, she said the motive isn’t money. “I went to Syria because I am personally interested in the country,” having met Syrians who told her about a homeland they themselves cannot visit, she said, “not because I was thinking about [YouTube] views or anything like that.”Such a trip would not be unusual in 2010, when 8.5 million tourists reportedly visited Syria. “Discover wonderful old Damascene houses, admire the mesmerizing gold mosaics of Umayyad Mosque, or savour the silence of the Palmyra ruins,” states a travel guide from Lonely Planet, last updated more than a decade ago. A lot has happened in that time. For one, there are now more ruins.At least 400,000 people had been killed as of April 2016, when the United Nations stopped counting; a month before, the international governing body accused the Syrian government of carrying out a policy of terror—of barrel bombs, sarin and chlorine gas—that amounts to the crime of “extermination.” Many of the 259,000 people who worked in tourism in 2010, according to the Syrian government, are dead or in exile; all had to find other work.Khaldoun Al-Alamy, 53, never left Damascus and is now in a position to benefit from the fact others are, slowly, coming back. From the start of the year until the end of August 2019, a spokesperson for the Syrian Ministry of Tourism said 1.5 million people visited the country, up 61 percent from the same period a year before. Al-Alamy runs a travel agency, Golden Target Tours, and he’s the one who arranged Eva’s trip. He told me he’s been fielding a slew of inquiries since she gave him a shout out, online.Hosn Castle, also known as Krak des Chevaliers.Mohamed AzakirOver the phone, he gave the same pitch he’s been desperately giving the last few years about Syria’s historical sites and friendly people, when his career became more a passion. “You can visit the biggest mosque in the area, the bazaar, the oldest church, old houses, everything,” he said. There’s an ancient Roman amphitheater, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, south of the capital in Bosra, and a medieval castle, Krak des Chevaliers, up north, near the border with Lebanon. His most popular tour, however, is for three nights in the capital. This, he said, has been his best year since war destroyed whatever business he had.“When you see the people coming and visiting and shopping, and the restaurants are all full,” he said between fits of coughing, “that gives you a really very nice, very positive feeling. You feel like life is returning. Life is normal. That there’s a future.”Tourists began returning in larger numbers after the Syrian regime crushed what was left of the armed resistance in Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, and Daraa, a province just south of the capital and considered by many to be the seat of the revolution. In early 2011, schoolchildren there were arrested over anti-regime graffiti—for telling “the doctor,” their opthamologist turned dictator, that he would be next to fall in the Arab Spring. One was subsequently tortured to death, the return of their 13-year-old body causing the town to erupt in protest, believing a better world was possible. In Syria, at least, it wasn’t, the world watching as the doctor set the country ablaze.* * *Today’s visitors are different than those who came before the war, when Syria was repressed but enjoying a false peace. “Most of them are young people, educated,” al-Alamy told me. “This is very important, because those people will be our ambassadors, let’s say, outside,” he said. And most are happy to fill that role; to boast of their adventures in a place that’s been barrel-bombed off the map of most other travelers.In Damascus, what’s long been a police state has long since been militarized. “There’s a checkpoint on every corner,” Joan Townsend Torres, a 31-year-old Spaniard who visited in 2018 and has authored a guide for those who wish to follow in his footsteps. And there are other military installations, he recalled, that make traditional tourist activities, like snapping photos of everything, a bit more risky, especially in a locale that associates photography with journalism—with subversion.“I always walk around with my big camera hanging from my shoulder,” Joan told me. And he had a number of conversations with soldiers asking him what he was up to, and insisting on a review of his photos. Most people, he said, are just happy to learn he’s not a reporter; that he’s a tourist, instead, “means that the country’s changing.”Outside the country, Joan said, the response is different.“You receive a lot of emails and messages from people… [who] are really, really angry that [someone] went to Syria because it’s, like, supporting the government and it’s unethical,” Joan acknowledged. Still, “I don’t think there’s anything bad about it. I mean, I didn’t take selfies with destroyed buildings behind me.”The actual number of visitors cannot be independently verified, and one tour operator in Damascus, “Ayoub,” requesting anonymity as “the situation is very sensitive,” said the government’s figures are almost certainly inflated, counting anyone who crosses the border, for any reason, as a “tourist.” But more are in fact coming. Excluding Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan, just under 142,000 foreigners officially stepped foot in Syria during the first two-thirds of 2019, according to the Ministry of Tourism, up 17 percent from the year before.“We don’t have a lot of tourists,” the tour operator in Damascus noted. “But now we have more.”Before the conflict, it was, generally, history—those ancient ruins in Palmyra, since desecrated by ISIS—that brought the tour groups. And history, generally, attracts an older crowd. During the height of the war, when rebel mortars still threatened neighborhoods in Damascus, visitors still came, but in solidarity: fascists who see allies in Baathism; anti-imperialists who see the leading contributor to violence in Syria, Bashar al-Assad, as a victim of a failed international conspiracy to forcibly change his regime.A general view shows ruins in the historic city of Palmyra, Syria March 4, 2017.Omar Sanadiki“The main reason for tourism now, it’s just, like, to show off, you know?” the Damascus tour operator told me. It’s a younger, more online set, eager to “show off on the social media to get some followers [and] a lot of likes.”It’s not inherently evil, that. Who doesn’t want to be liked? Nor is it fair to say those who go to Syria have not grappled with the ethics of that decision; they have ultimately decided it is okay, of course, but they are not oblivious. The question is really whether Syria is exceptional — that is, while visitors insist they are not doing politics, is it possible not to? Or, as some maintain, is it really no different than visiting anywhere else in the world with a less than stellar head of state? There is a difference, of course: almost nowhere is as bad as Syria, a condemnation of its regime more than absolution for any other. And there are millions in a diaspora who cannot do what a white tourist can: step foot in their homeland. On an emotional level, the tourists I interviewed understood this, even if they ultimately rejected the logic for boycotting travel to Syria. It’s not lost on their tour operators, either.“Yeah, I know this,” the Damascus tour operator confessed, after a pregnant silence, when I asked if he could understand some Syrians’ anger toward the mostly European tourists who purchase his services. “I lost my home during the war,” he said, and “a lot of my friends” are now abroad, most in Germany. They cannot enter regime-held Syria, suspected of opposition sympathies or wanted for military service—or subject to arrest just for leaving the country without permission.Native-born Germans, on the other hand: “When they start seeing the refugees, they get more curious to go to that country to see where these people came from,” he said. “They meet a Syrian and they start talking and they [the Syrian] tell them, like, ‘I wish I could go back to my country.’” And so they, the Germans, visit on their behalf “and bring him something from the ground.”Others, on the “influencer” end of the spectrum, can sometimes be less admirable, treating the source of so much pain in this young and brutal 21st century as a playground—another stop on a social media tour, with an expectation that with Insta-fame comes generosity, toward them. One, the operator said, “chose to arrive here on Ramadan, because they give a lot of [free] meals. And she stayed on CouchSurfing with a Syrian girl. And so she traveled without spending any money.”He himself would like to travel to Italy someday, but that would cost something far beyond the means of most Syrians; they are lucky to make $100 a month these days, down from $1,000 before the war, or what most in government-controlled areas term “the conflict,” so as to not suggest parity between sides. And so this tour operator, in school to become the sort of licensed guide to this police state’s foreign visitors, has never been a tourist himself. “I grew up during the war,” he explained. “I didn’t have a chance.”Most refugees are destitute, and while some who stayed behind were able to do so thanks to their wealth and power, not fearing arbitrary arrest or worse, many others lacked the means to head somewhere not at war. And it’s too late now. In an age of militarized borders, where the hypocrisies of liberal internationalism have given way to the open malice of right-wing authoritarianism, where would they go? Doors are closing, and many of those who did make it out can never return in the absence of a change in regime. Those who can safely visit Syria are those with no public record of criticizing the government, or any demonstrable ties to those who have. A wrong bet—a mistaken faith in Damascus’ haphazard talk of reconciliation—can result in one disappearing in a torture chamber like Sednaya, a prison where “Syrian authorities have quietly and methodically organized the killing of thousands of people in their custody,” according to Amnesty International. A correct assessment of the risk, however, can also lead one to sip wine and post selfies to Instagram just outside that detention center, like Russian state propagandists and French fascists, such guests of honor spared the need for a regime minder.The contradiction between sight-seeing and immense human suffering is not lost on all who come. After the normalcy of Damascus, Eva visited Aleppo to see ruins that weren’t on any tourist’s agenda prior to 2011. Her tone, as she walks among the half of the city once occupied by rebels, and destroyed by the government, is markedly different: “This isn’t fun,” would be any viewer’s takeaway.“I just felt, frankly, quite saddened by the whole situation,” Eva told me later, speaking as she walked the streets of her latest stop, Mexico City. “And I think it is absolutely tragic that people who are from the country cannot come back.” She’s been to other politically fraught destinations, including Iran and Yemen. But her pre-war interest in Syria, she said, was renewed by a flight from Dubai. The man in the seat next to her was originally from Syria, and unable to return. “You can probably go as a foreigner,” she recalls him saying. “Just, if you go, can you please just kiss Aleppo for me?”“I think that Syria is a destination that you can only visit if you’re prepared to be uncomfortable,” Eva told me, “and potentially be in a situation that is not safe—and be prepared to be extremely sensitive,” said, “because this is not a beach in Thailand.”The Syrian government has, in its haphazard way, promoted the idea that it kind of is, though. On its YouTube channel, the Syrian Ministry of Tourism posts footage of young people in bikinis enjoying the emerald waters off the coast of Latakia; amid the 2016 siege of Aleppo, Syrian state media published video boasting of the “thriving nightlife” in the government-held Western half of the city.Tourists who visit tend to highlight the same things as the regime’s propagandists: the good, not the bad. This isn’t because most are shills for a government that is largely responsible for the worst bloodshed most of us have seen in our lifetime. It’s the limits of the genre: travel bloggers are not journalists, and travel blogging is not journalism.But isn’t it, really? Going to a foreign land and reporting back on what you saw is awfully close to what someone called a “reporter” would do. In this age of mass media layoffs, however, the role of the professional is increasingly filled by independent amateurs. That the Syrian state allows in the latter may not be an explicit propaganda strategy, but that some tourists are active and influential on social media—and uninterested in politicizing their experience or explaining who killed who, if they even know enough to speculate—is undoubtedly a service to the cause of normalizing a rogue, murderous state.Eva is no apologist for tyranny in Syria anymore than she, by visiting the United States, is a de facto supporter of Donald Trump. She is, again, a travel blogger eager to describe her excursions, which often take her to places with complex political realities on which she does not opine. Indeed, when it comes to politics and travel, “I don’t know [that] there’s a relation between those two things,” she told me.Perhaps it is unfair to expect sophisticated political analysis from a tourist on a short excursion; perhaps, in fact, it is better that they refrain and save us and them the embarrassment of a half-baked perspective, informed by taxi drivers and Wikipedia. But its absence speaks, too.I, for one, was initially unfair toward Eva, answering her video from Damascus with social media posts of my own, thinking her engaged in propaganda, conscious or not. How ghoulish, I maintained, to omit the war—to assert from the start that this elephant would not be discussed—while celebrating a capital, bloated by the internally displaced from wrecked suburbs, as a tourist destination like any other. But in her eyes, and in her approach, that is exactly what it was and remains: a place on Earth, unique, with beautiful sites, friendly people and messy politics.* * *Syria isn’t really like any other place, though. More than half its population has been displaced. Activists aren’t just spied on and harassed by police, but tortured and killed—just blocks away from where you, the useful traveler, may have raved about the dessert.If something is perceived as propaganda, does it matter then if that was not the intent? If it’s unthinking, that may just mean it’s more effective.“I mean, I don’t think it’s possible to be apolitical in this context!” said Yasmin Fedda, a filmmaker whose 2012 documentary, A Tale of Two Syrias, explored the lives of pre-war Damascenes, and the brutality and hardship that precipitated an uprising. “It’s very naive to think so and shows a lack of understanding.”Fedda is one of nearly 100 Syrian filmmakers who signed an October 14 open letter signed by decrying the “increasingly common” practice of regime-approved, foreign directors using unreconstructed war zones in their productions. “These devastated towns and cities [are] transformed into cinematic backdrops,” they wrote, the scene of war crimes and forced displacement “used as movie sets for regime-sponsored films.”Tourists may be subject to less intensive vetting, but they are welcomed for the same reason: to be, as the tour operator al-Alamy said, “ambassadors”—to promote a positive image of the country abroad; to do what travel bloggers do everywhere they go: present their experiences in a generally pleasant light that makes others want to do the same, and a touch jealous that they haven’t already.Kristyan Benedict, a campaigner at Amnesty International, thinks likewise. “Any organised tourism will almost certainly be controlled by the Assad regime, which will seek to profit from it financially while using it as a PR tool as part of its campaign to claim Syria is back to normal,” he told me. At the same time, “Tourists who venture into Syria should be aware of the very grave risks—including kidnapping and car bombs—and be prepared to massively self-censor or risk falling foul of Assad’s intelligence forces,” he told me. Going at all, he argued, is to lend credibility to a regime eager to use foreign visitors “as a PR tool in its campaign to claim Syria is back to normal.”But after eight years of war, that is also what many Syrians desire: a return, if not to “normal,” to the mundane, everyday repression of a hereditary dictatorship—less cruel, while perversely brutal, if only because it was more confident. A false peace is, at the end of a civil war, preferable to death.* * *Jamila, a 20-something who works as a translator in Damascus, has long been enchanted by the world outside of her own troubled slice of it. She’s never been beyond Lebanon, lacking the opportunity and the money to go any further, but some years back she joined Couchsurfing, a networking website for international travelers. Typically, as the name may suggest, it works like this: tourists find locals willing to put them up, and then they sleep on their couch. Damascus has almost 1,900 such “hosts,” according to the site, but hosting a foreigner in Syria is risky business: it’s not really legal.“I didn’t know it was dangerous,” Jamila told me over the phone. She signed up as a teenager, looking to meet people from abroad and practice her English. But she has never actually hosted a traveler; inviting a stranger into your home may be a typical act of Syrian hospitality, but letting them sleep there? Until the suburbs of Damascus were subdued, Jamila said military patrols would go door to door, demanding to see each household’s “family book”—a ledger of inhabitants registered with the state. Anyone not on the page, but inside the house, could be perceived as a draft dodger or a terrorist, which is to say a member of the opposition. So, instead of letting anyone surf her couch, Jamila has used the site as a social network, offering foreigners advice on what to see and do, and meeting up with them when they arrive.That can be dangerous too. Who are these people? Until recently, such visitors would be journalists who, if perceived as critical, would be subject to all the surveillance a police state can muster. And while paranoia has lessened somewhat, there are stories Jamila shared about such encounters that cannot be published without risking her liberty, even with the relative freedom of anonymity.You needn’t do anything wrong to end up in trouble with the Syrian authorities. Someone further up in the hierarchy of power could decide to haul you in for an interrogation, because that foreigner you spoke to could be perceived as a spy, or a journalist, or they just might need someone to blame for a screw up—someone being allowed into the country that shouldn’t have been, sometimes just in hindsight—who isn’t further up than them.Tour operators can’t take any chances; running afoul of the state could mean, at best, no more visas for your customers. For that reason they can’t just rely on the government’s background check when considering whether to admit a traveler; they scour social media, from LinkedIn to Instagram, to ensure that Western influencer isn’t actually a Western journalist. “I Google the name,” said Ayoub, the Damascus tour operator, “because if I discover that you work with international organizations, or journalists—especially the journalists—and they have not discovered this in the Department of Immigration, when trouble happens I’m going to be responsible.”It’s happened before. All the tour operators I spoke to, and most of the tourists, were familiar with a story from late 2018, which changed everything—or at least made explicit who would be blamed for a heavy-handed police state doing what heavy-handed police states do. A young German tourist, in some tellings a “journalist,” was taking photos on the outskirts of Damascus. While it might be okay to take photos of some damage, and impossible not to encounter it on one’s journey, entire suburbs have been decimated during the course of the war—and access to them highly curtailed, for propaganda purposes. “I was the tourist who encountered significant problems, and thought an explanation was in order,” Felix Mechnig-Giordano, posted to the private Facebook group, Every Passport Stamp. “While walking around Damascus I came across one of the destroyed suburbs and asked a soldier if it was possible for me to enter,” he wrote. “While no one was concerned at first, this ended up with me being blindfolded, handcuffed and thrown into a secret police van.” He spent the next five days in a military prison at the Mezze military base, where leaked photos from a regime defector show that thousands have been executed since 2011, just a few miles from bars and restaurants.“At some point, someone had accused me of being a spy,” Mechnig-Giordano wrote. The interrogation soon revealed that to be untrue, but that is not what saved him: his nationality did. “[I]t demonstrated how vulnerable foreign visitors remain to arbitrary detention, and that at basically any opportunity anyone can accuse [anyone] of pretty much anything, leading to arrest and worst.” And, he continued, “While my German passport protected me from any sort of physical harm, the same could not be said for the hundreds of Syrians I saw being held and tortured. As the secret police so loved reminding me, you are pretty much screwed and at their mercy with no possibility of consular assistance once you are detained.”His travel agent fled the country, which didn’t help appearances. After that incident, an unspoken rule became an explicit requirement that all Western tourists—shorthand for about everyone outside Syria’s immediate neighbors—be accompanied by a guide at all times. These are not government agents, but they serve a purpose: keeping an eye on the guests and steering them and their interlocutors away from the problematic.But the sanitized version of Syria on display in some content is not the product of state censorship nor of malice on the creator’s part. It’s the form; these are vacation highlights, accenting the virtues of a destination and its people. And there is an argument for not letting 18 million people be defined solely by their relationship to a hereditary war criminal.“When we hear ‘Syria,’ we tend to think of all the negative things we’ve been hearing in the news, on TV,” Stefan Gentsch says in one of his YouTube videos. A 33-year-old travel blogger who resides in Singapore, he visited Damascus for the first time in late 2018, his visa sponsored by an old friend. His experience, as presented online, is a rejoinder of sorts—to the idea that Syria is defined only by its war and its dictator. His videos showcase the Syrian people’s legendary hospitality (most people think he’s Russian), and in one he travels outside Damascus to a town called Maaraba, which is unlikely to be on anyone else’s itinerary. There he tours a bread factory and gets invited to a wedding where he is peer-pressured into dancing.“Being in Syria, being at this wedding, I witnessed something that even before my trip, I might not have imagined Syria to be like. People dancing and enjoying themselves… It’s such a contrast to what think of as Syria.”He had a good time, and there’s a powerful argument that human beings should not be divided by borders, or cede the inalienable right to cultural exchange because crossing a line on a map might be perceived as a political act.But it’s what Stefan told me over the phone about his trip to Maaraba that I found most interesting: an omission, not the product of malice, that might have altered the viewer’s perception of Syria, and bolstered the latter’s infamy as a bastion of arbitrary oppression. He was detained—by police or the military he isn’t sure. “I did get in a little bit of trouble,” he told me. His Syrian friend, and visa sponsor, walked into a shop in Maraaba, a town, held by rebels until early 2018, where tour operators I asked said no tourist should be (“Tourists go to the touristic sites. Why are you going to empty places?” an alarmed al-Alamy said. “You are putting yourself in a bad position.”). As his friend was shopping, Stefan was on the street, snapping photos of nothing in particular, as tourists do. That’s when a man in uniform approached him speaking Arabic, a language he did not understand. Still, he got the gist. “He didn’t like that I had taken a picture.” And so the officer took him to a station, where was detained for a couple hours. “I was just sitting there, smiling,” he said. “I was not concerned about ending up in prison. My concern, or my biggest concern, was that maybe my phone will be confiscated and I would lose all the pictures I had taken on the trip.” While it was what led to his detention, &quot;there&#39;s nothing special about the photo, it&#39;s an ordinary photo on the street to Maaraba,&quot; said Gentsch.Stefan GentschThere is no video of the incident, which ended with a superior, upon concluding that he was not in fact a spy or a one-man ISIS splinter cell, saying he could take all the photos he wants (“You’re a tourist!”). Accordingly, it is not on YouTube, and the impression, thus, is one of a country not quite as totalitarian as it was in reality. It is not propaganda, by any means. Still, Stefan told me he’s noticed his content being exploited by partisans who comment on his videos. “They might say something like, ‘Oh, if a German tourist can go to Syria, then why do Syrian refugees have to be let into Europe?’” And supporters of the Syrian regime—there is some crossover—will say “Assad is the greatest, he made this beautiful country safe again.”There are Assad’s opponents, too. They’ll say, “How can you report about how beautiful your experience was in Damascus, when 100,000 people have died under Assad’s rule?” Stefan said. It is a question he thought about. “The conclusion that I always tend to reach whenever I think about is that I’m traveling as a tourist, I know I do, and I don’t have any political motivation,” he told me. “I’m simply there to walk onto the streets to talk to everyday people, and to see what life is like.” Some do, however, intend to challenge the prevailing narrative on Syria—not just by humanizing people typically relegated to the status of voiceless bystander, or by simply leaving out an unpleasant encounter. Some are more consciously political, even if they still lean more tourist than activist. “Sitting in Damascus, having a beer, you had jet flights flying over head, fighting in the suburbs,” said Christian Lindgren, a 31-year-old Norwegian who visited in 2017. “There were no tourists in the country whatsoever.” The next year, when he returned following the regime’s military conquest of the suburbs, “it was much, much calmer. Like being in a different country.”But it still has its rules, like any other. Christian noted what happened to Felix, whom he described as a friend he met through travel forums online. “Wrong place at the wrong time,” is how he described his friend’s detention. “When you go there, any war zone with a lot of military and police, there’s places you shouldn’t take pictures of. It’s that simple.”But you should still try to visit. “When you go there, you’ll never trust Western media again,” he insisted. Indeed, his blog on his latest trip insists “there’s far less destruction in Aleppo than what the media has been telling us.” And there is, despite the tight controls on where one can visit and what one can do there, a sort of freedom, if only perceived: “I was granted full access,” he maintained. “I was even allowed to visit a school that Desh (ISIS) and al Qaeda used as headquarters.” (ISIS and al Qaeda were bitter opponents, and the former did not have a significant presence in rebel-held Aleppo).When I asked how he could be so sure he was getting the straight news in one of the most dangerous countries to be a journalist, he told me a rule he’s picked up in his travels. “Go to a bar, have a few drinks with the locals, and you’ll really get an honest answer,” he said. “In any country in the world, it’s the same.” “I’ve gone to so many places that seemed dangerous, in the media,” Christian explained, “and I’ve gotten so much criticism for it. But none of those people that gave criticisms have been to those places.”* * *Sarah Hunaidi has been to Syria. She lived there until 2014; like millions of others, she was forced to flee her home over the crime of opposing state-sanctioned murder. She does not necessarily oppose others doing what she cannot—set foot in the place she called home—but she does think that with privilege comes certain responsibilities.“Touring Syria and meeting Syrian people and buying goods to benefit them is one thing,” Hunaidi told me, “and taking vlogs and video and ‘reporting’ about ‘the truth’ is another.” The main difference between an ethical tourist and, frankly, an asshole, is conscientiousness—being aware of where, exactly, you are. “By existing in a war zone, you are part of the war,” she told me. And one can’t avoid politics when your being there, while journalists and refugees cannot, as approving of your presence was itself a political decision by those who started that war.Shiyam Ghalyon is a Syrian-American who works for the War Resisters League, an anti-imperialist organization in New York City. Her sin, in the eyes of Damascus, is being too consistent—opposing war crimes in Syria, no matter the party that carried them out. That means, primarily, condemning the leading perpetrator of violence since 2011: the government that stamps the passports. And that means, in turn, accepting that she cannot step foot in any territory that government controls.“I do not have a blanket opposition to go to Syria, but I do think it should be a requirement to be very purposeful and intentional,” Ghalyon said. “In general, one should be thoughtful of how they move between local communities—but especially when the local communities are experiencing severe and systemic government brutality.”Many travelers are thoughtful (some a good deal more than others) and do express a conscious familiarity with where they are from, the privilege that affords them, and where they have been: a devastated country full of traumatized people who could go to jail, or worse, if they were to provide a complete stranger, from abroad, a truly authentic experience in Syria. Self-censorship is not an allegation, but a fact of life, awareness of which is the prerequisite sought by many in the Syrian diaspora.“I never brought up the subject of politics,” said Joan, the Spanish travel blogger. He has a business relationship with a local tour operator, to whom he refers prospective visitors; he isn’t naive when it comes to where he’s sending them, and why the people there may offer a gentler-than-mainstream take on the head of their police state. “Usually, most people would say that they like Bashar al-Assad,” Joan recounted, “but I mean, there’s a very simple reason: the people who don’t like him are either dead or they escaped from the country.”In fact, he told me, Syria is a bit like Spain—“when we were under military dictatorship, led by Franco,” who, like Bashar’s father, ruled until death, after killing tens of thousands. In Franco’s Spain as in Assad’s Syria, it would be wrong to confuse post-war resignation with anything more than a desire to return to something approaching normal.“I mean, regardless of whether he’s a murderer or not, he brought now stability to the country, right? It was a civil war going on. And he won. And now, finally, he’s rolling,” Joan said.* * *There’s a thin line between exposure and exploitation. Traveling to a war-torn nation and posting footage of the destruction could raise awareness, or it could be an exercise in showcasing the traveler’s superior empathy—crass, superficial and gross. It’s a delicate balance that some avoid by omitting the war altogether. By focusing on the positive amid the rubble, though, one runs the risk of the same offense: failing to capture the gravity of the situation. Is it actually more perverse to carry on as if nothing is wrong?Xavier Raychell Blancharde, a British-Polish college student who visited Syria as an 18-year-old, stressed that when I asked about the upcoming tour he’s arranging. For $1,300, tourists can accompany him on a January 2020 trip to Damascus, Maaloula, Krak de Chevaliers and Bosra al Sham, a Roman amphitheater recently re-opened to tourism. “I’ve been to Syria twice now,” he told me. “While we will certainly not attempt to hide the tragedy that has taken place in the country, we will also not specifically be heading to destroyed neighborhoods as a tourist group, for I personally find this extremely disrespectful and immoral. It is not ‘war tourism.’”In a video on a recent trip to coastal Latakia—which comes with the disclaimer that it “is NOT intended to be political”—he too compared the nation to Spain. But, again, it wasn’t political, at least not overtly. “The landscape is really similar, I think, to some places I’ve been to in southern Spain. And I think very few people would actually imagine that this is Syria…. People have a stereotyped image of the place, and this just completely breaks down that stereotype,” he said.That Syria has beautiful places cannot be denied. Focusing on that may be a travel blogger’s purview, but it is also no doubt a coup for the regime whenever natural beauty, and not human-wrought destruction, is the focus of a Westerner’s piece of content.Jamila, the Syrian Couchsurfer, said most visitors don’t try to get into matters of death and punishment. “They all know that we cannot speak a lot about politics. They would just maybe comment, ‘We didn’t know people loved your president.’ These would be the comments. But they wouldn’t ask too much.”That many in the Syrian diaspora object to tourists taking selfies in Damascus (with rubble or otherwise) is understandable, to her, but she welcomes these visitors, and is happy more than just reporters are showing up these days. “I understand them completely,” she said. “They think of tourists coming back as funding the government and they are against the government. They would say you’re helping the government kill the Syrian people.”Still, she argued, “most Syrians who live in Syria want tourists, and most people who don’t live in Syria don’t want tourists” At the very least, it’s good for the economy. “Our life is not even the minimum life,” she told me. “We are like really, really poor. Everyone here is really poor. Tourism would benefit people who are living here.” And, she said, “Whether we like it or not, the government did win.”But most of those Syrians outside the country couldn’t come back, even if they didn’t already object to foreigners touring their former home. Syrians who left the country are inherently suspect. Why would you go? And according to the Syrian Association for Citizens’ Dignity, two-thirds of those who have returned, to live if not to visit, say either they or a relative are wanted for arrest by the regime, which remains hungry for conscripts to fight in a country very much at war. Most, overwhelmingly, regret their decision to return. Others could not be asked: since coming back they have disappeared. It’s the insensitive traveler who Jamila wishes would avoid her country. “I think there’s a type where they see us Syrians as aliens, as just like their little research project,” she told me. She had one white guy in mind. “He treats our misery as an experience. He treats our war, and the things we’ve been going through, as a thrilling experience.” And this type also believes a holiday can be a fact-finding mission. In truth, “We cannot speak a lot about politics, and if we spoke we’re not going to say everything we’re thinking about, because we’re not free to say whatever we want.”So don’t do that, if you go. Don’t expect your eyes and ears will always receive the truth; sometimes the ground can obstruct the senses. And know one thing: whatever your troubles, you are the lucky, privileged one in every interaction. Maybe that, more than any expose beyond the paygrade of the amateur or uninitiated, is what any traveler to Syria has a responsibility to convey. If you go, in other words, speak the truths that might prevent you from ever going back. Syrians could relate to that.“Syria is safe for foreigners, 100 percent, and yes, come please and support us because we need every single penny,” Jamila told me. “But,” she stressed, “it is not safe for Syrians.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Heroin would be available on prescription and cannabis clubs would be permitted, allowing marijuana to be grown and consumed by adults. Welfare The Greens would introduce a universal basic income, providing every UK citizen with £89 per week in state funding. It would provide a boost to those in work and leave no-one on benefits worse off, according to the manifesto. Health Party leaders have promised to increase funding for the NHS by at least £6 billion each year until 2030 - a 4.5% increase on the 2018/19 budget. Privatisation in the NHS would also be abolished, while mental health care would be put on an &quot;equal footing&quot; with physical care. Education The party pledges to boost education funding by at least £4 billion per year and to lay down a long-term aim of reducing classes to 20 pupils and below. Ofsted would be replaced with a &quot;collaborative system of assessing&quot; schools and a new law would put onus on teaching children about climate change.

Members of the public wrestled with the suspect before armed police shot him dead.Confirming that two people had died, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick praised the “extraordinary courage” of those who tackled the man. Prime Minister Boris Johnson broke away from the general election campaign to rush back to his Downing Street offices, and will chair an emergency “Cobra” meeting this evening.Key Developments:Police shoot dead male terror suspect after stabbing in London Bridge at about 2 p.m.Two civilians killed in the attack, three being treated in hospital, police saidOfficers say suspect had a hoax bomb strapped to his bodyJohnson returned from his constituency to Number 10 for updates on incident; will chair emergency ‘Cobra’ meeting at 9:30 p.m.Labour suspends election campaigning in London on FridaySecurity strengthened around British capital, with more armed police deployed after terrorist attackPolice Trying to Identity Victims (8:25 p.m.)Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said officers are still working to identify the people killed in Friday’s terrorist attack and that three others are being treated in the hospital. ‘Our counter-terrorists detectives will be working around the clock to identify those who have lost their lives, to support all the victims and their families,” she said.“We will be working as fast as we can to understand who this man is, where he comes from and whether there is anyone else who we need to find quickly,” Dick said. She said she expects police cordons to remain in the area “for some time.”Dick said the attack started at Fishmonger’s Hall, a livery company building on the north side of London Bridge, and said members of the public had shown “extraordinary courage stepping in to tackle this attacker.”U.K. Police Confirm Two Dead (8:15 p.m.)U.K. police confirmed two members of the public died in the terror attack on London Bridge. “As well as the suspect, who was shot dead by police, two of those injured in this attack in the London Bridge area have tragically lost their lives,” Cressida Dick, Metropolitan Police commissioner, said in a statement outside the London police service’s headquarters.“My heart goes out to their loved ones and to the three further injured victims who I understand are being treated at hospital,” she said. “The empty ideology of terror offers nothing but terror and today I urge everybody to reject that.”Johnson Cancels Saturday Campaign Events (7:50 p.m.)Prime Minister Boris Johnson canceled his planned events for campaigning in the election on Saturday, a Tory official said. He will focus instead on the government’s response to the London Bridge attack.The premier will lead a meeting of the government’s emergency “Cobra” committee at 9:30 p.m., his office said. He called Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to discuss the incident earlier on Friday.Labour Suspends London Campaigning (6:50 p.m.)Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn suspended his party’s campaigning in London for Friday evening as he called on the U.K.’s “democratic process not to be derailed by terror.”“We are suspending campaigning in London tonight as a mark of respect for those who suffered in this attack,” Corbyn said in an emailed statement. “We will not be cowed by those who threaten us. We must and we will stand together to reject hatred and division.”Earlier Conservative leader Boris Johnson suspended his own campaigning for Friday evening.Two People Dead After Attack: BBC (6:36 p.m.)Two members of the public have died after the London Bridge attack, the BBC reported, citing a government source.Earlier the police said several people had been injured during the stabbing at a premises near London Bridge. A spokeswoman for the Met Police was unable to confirm the report.Johnson Praises Civilians Who Stopped Attacker (5:45 p.m.)Boris Johnson vowed to bring all involved in the attack to justice, promising the U.K. will not be intimidated by terrorism.“Anybody involved in this crime and these attacks will be hunted down and will be brought to justice,” Johnson said in a pooled TV clip. “This country will never be cowed or divided or intimidated by this sort of attack, and our values -- our British values -- will prevail.”Johnson said he would stop his own campaigning this evening and he would be reviewing the matter in the next few hours. In the middle of the 2017 election, campaigning was suspended across all parties after a terrorist attack.“I urge everyone to be vigilant and one cannot help but think back to what happened in 2017 in a similar part of the city, and I hope people as fast as possible will be able to go back to their business,” he said.Mayor Urges Londoners to ‘Stand Resolute’ (4:55 p.m.)Mayor of London Sadiq Khan called on his city to “stand united and resolute in the face of terror” in the aftermath of the “cowardly and evil” attack.Khan praised the “breathtaking heroism from members of the public who literally ran towards the danger, not knowing what confronted them.” he said they didn’t know the bomb strapped to the suspect was a hoax. “They really are the best of us, another example of the bravery and heroism of ordinary Londoners running towards danger, risking their own personal safety to try and save others,” he said.“I’m mayor of the greatest city in the world -- one of our strengths is our diversity,” he told journalists outside the Metropolitan Police headquarters. “We do know there are people out there who hate our diversity, who hate what we stand for and are trying to seek to divide us.”Khan said the attack on London Bridge “appeared to be an isolated incident,” and the police aren’t looking for any other suspects.Trump Pledges Support to U.K. (4:40 p.m.)U.S. President Donald Trump condemned the violence on London Bridge and offered his country’s full support, a spokesman said.“President Trump has been briefed on this morning’s attack at the London Bridge and is monitoring the situation,” said Judd Deere, deputy press secretary at the White House. “The United States strongly condemns all horrific acts of violence on innocent people, and we pledge our full support to our Ally, the United Kingdom.”Trump is due to visit the U.K. next week for a NATO summit.Police: London Bridge Attack Was Terrorism (4:24 p.m.)U.K. police confirmed they had shot dead one male suspect and declared the attack a terrorist incident. “I’m now in a position to confirm that it has been declared a terrorist incident,” said Neil Basu, Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner, in a statement outside the London police service’s headquarters. “I must stress we retain an open mind as to any motive. It would be inappropriate to speculate further at this time.”He added the police believe the item strapped to the body of the suspect was a hoax explosive device.Police Ordered Diners to Flee (4 p.m.)The streets around London Bridge were locked down and armed police cleared restaurants and shops in the area. Officers are treating the incident as terror-related “as a precaution,” although the circumstances are still unclear, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.During the incident on Friday, armed officers burst into restaurants in the Borough Market area at London Bridge and urged diners to leave as fast as possible. They shouted “Out, out, out,” to people at the Black and Blue bar. Diners walked away with their hands on their heads. Nearby, police shouted to pedestrians to “run.”Officers closed off the bridge and evacuated passers-by from the surrounding area. On the north bank of the River Thames, police officers shouted to pedestrians to move back from the bridge 100 meters, and then urged them to take shelter in any nearby building, shouting: “Move inside for your own safety.”Incident Revives Memories of 2017 Attack (3:45 p.m.)The same area of London was the scene of a terrorist attack just a few days before the general election in June 2017 in which eight people were killed and 48 injured. Three Islamist terrorists drove a van at pedestrians on the bridge before arming themselves with knives and running into Borough Market, where they stabbed people in restaurants and pubs. Armed police responded and killed the attackers.Johnson returning to Central London (3:35 p.m.)Boris Johnson is returning to his office in central London after police shot a man at London Bridge and a number of people were injured.“The prime minister is on his way back to No 10 from his constituency where he will receive further updates on the London Bridge incident,” Johnson’s spokesman James Slack said in a statement.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also expressed his concern. “Shocking reports from London Bridge. My thoughts are with those caught up in the incident. Thank you to the police and emergency services who are responding,” he said on Twitter.Johnson Being Kept Updated on London Incident (3:10 p.m.)Boris Johnson said he’s being kept informed about the unfolding incident at London Bridge, in which there have been reports of gunshots and stabbings. Police said they are “currently responding to this incident as though it is terror-related.”Armed police locked down the bridge and evacuated the area. The Metropolitan Police said in a statement that after being called to a stabbing at a premises nearby, they had detained one man. A number of people have been injured, they said.“I’m being kept updated on the incident at London Bridge and want to thank the police and all emergency services for their immediate response,” Johnson said on Twitter.Home Secretary Priti Patel also posted on Twitter, saying she’s “very concerned by ongoing incident at London Bridge. My thoughts are with all affected.” She urged people to follow the advice of the police. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he’s in “close contact” with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner.Corbyn in Fresh Attack on Billionaires (12:45 p.m.)Jeremy Corbyn opened a new broadside on billionaires opposing his plans for a re-distributive socialist economy after The Daily Mail and General Trust bought the i newspaper in a 50 million pound deal ($64.5 million).“Two billionaire press barons now own half of the top 10 daily newspapers,” Corbyn said in a posting on Twitter. “Remember this when they attack Labour’s plan to make the super-rich pay their fair share.”“We are committed to preserving its distinctive, high quality and politically independent editorial style,” DMGT said in a statement on its acquisition of the i newspaper.Free Trade Group Attacks State Aid Proposals (12:20 p.m.)The Adam Smith Institute, a think tank aimed at promoting free trade which had close links with former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said it was disappointed with Boris Johnson’s plan to change state aid rules and procurement provisions to make it easier to support British companies, calling it a “form of Trumpian protectionism.”“We shouldn’t free ourselves from the European Union in order to just enslave ourselves to the whims of Whitehall,” said Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute. “Making a profit is a proof of the value added to society, and there must be no business that is too big to fail.”Tories Pledge Tougher Foreign Takeover Rules (12:05 p.m.)The Conservatives plan to strengthen protections against foreign takeovers of British companies, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said, in answer to a question about Chinese investment in the U.K.“We certainly don’t believe that the current provisions which are in place are robust enough,” Gove said at a press conference. He said he’s undertaken to “strengthen” a unit in his department that examines foreign takeovers, and “strengthen protections in the future.”Speaking alongside him, Boris Johnson agreed, before saying the country must strike a “balance” between “continuing to be open to investment from China” and making sure the U.K. doesn’t do anything “that prejudices our critical national infrastructure, our security, or do anything that would compromise our ability to cooperate with five-eyes security partners.”“Those are the parameters,” Johnson said. “I am very, very far from a Sinophobe. I want to have good relations with China, but there are clear difficulties and clear boundaries that we have to set.”U.K.’s No-Deal Preparations to Continue (12 p.m.)Boris Johnson confirmed the U.K. will continue to make preparations for a disorderly exit from the European Union. “Of course the preparations will remain extant,” he said. “There’s no reason to dismantle them.”He described the preparations which he put in place prior to the Oct. 31 deadline as being “thoroughly useful” in achieving the deal made with the EU, as it convinced Brussels the U.K. was “in earnest” about leaving.Johnson said he is confident of completing a deal with the EU by the end of 2020 and “sees no reason” to extend that deadline, meaning the U.K. crashing out without a deal is still a possibility.State Aid Plan Compatible With EU: Johnson (11:50 a.m.)Taking questions from the press after his speech, Boris Johnson said that “of course” the U.K.’s new state aid rules (see 11:35 a.m.) would be compatible with those of the European Union, dismissing the idea that they could endanger a new free trade deal with the bloc.“Were there to be any issues arising, then as you know, under any big free trade deal, there’s a joint committee to arbitrate on whether some unfair subsidy or dispensation has been made,” Johnson said. “But it would be a committee of sovereign equals.”Johnson later said he believed in competition and in a “level playing field.”Tories Vow to Change Public Procurement (11:40 a.m)The Tories vowed to break away from EU state aid rules that the party said have a “chilling effect” on government support for industry, because of the need to wait for “months or years” for decisions on whether measures by member states are permissible or not.Existing rules “mean that the U.K. government cannot take steps to quickly and effectively help companies that are in danger,” the Conservative Party said in the statement. New rules will be developed in consultation with British businesses, it said.The Tories promised a new state aid system that sets out clear principles when the government will intervene, based on the U.K.’s needs. Ministers will have “more discretion” over decisions, which they will be able to take within “days.” A new government body would be set up to manage the system, the party said.On public procurement, the Tories pledged to ditch “absurdly complex” EU rules with their “pointless tendering requirements.” It also promised “simpler and cheaper” regulations that are “geared towards supporting local business and promoting British business.” The new system will be in place by Jan. 2021.Tories Announce State Aid Plans (11:35 a.m.)The Conservatives unveiled a package of measures that they described as “immediate steps to realize the benefits of Brexit,” including a pledge to overhaul the country’s state aid system to make it “faster and easier for the government to intervene to protect jobs when an industry is in trouble.”A Tory government will also change public procurement policy to support local businesses and promote a “buy British” approach for public bodies that purchase food, in an effort to back farmers, the party said in an email.“People voted to take back control -- and we want to deliver that change,” Johnson said in a statement. “One of the crucial ways we will do that is by improving our rules so that we can back British businesses and unleash their true potential.”Stuart Tells Labour Voters to Back Johnson (11:30 a.m.)Gisela Stuart, the former Labour MP who helped run the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum, urged traditional Labour voters to back the Conservatives in what she called the Dec. 12 “Brexit election.”“Voting for Brexit this time does not make me a Tory now or in the future,” Stuart said as she stood alongside Johnson and Michael Gove. “Rather, it is the best option.”Labour Step Up Pressure Over Johnson Comments (10:40 a.m.)Labour criticized Prime Minister Boris Johnson over past remarks he made about single mothers in a column from the 1990s (See 10 a.m.)“Boris Johnson’s refusal to apologize for his hateful comments about single mothers, their children and working class men is an absolute disgrace,” Labour’s education spokeswoman, Angela Rayner, who has herself been a single mother, said in a statement. “He tried to deny what he wrote, but the evidence is there in black and white for us all to see, proving once again that he’s a liar as well as a sexist.”Johnson Signals to Trump to Stay Quiet (10:15 a.m.)Ahead of Donald Trump’s visit to the U.K. next week, Boris Johnson said the two allies “traditionally” do not get involved in each others’ domestic politics -- an apparent signal to the U.S. president not to say anything that could potentially undermine the Conservative Party’s election campaign.“We have very close relationships with the United States at every level of government, but what we don’t do traditionally -- as loving allies and friends -- is get involved in each other’s election campaigns,” Johnson told LBC radio.The comment comes amid Tory party fears of an intervention by the president in the run-up to the Dec. 12 vote. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is using Johnson’s links to the president and pursuit of a post-Brexit U.S. trade as a central attack line in the campaign, especially on the potential dangers to Britain’s state-run National Health Service.Johnson pointed out that former President Barack Obama’s intervention in the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign didn’t help the government’s argument for staying in the European Union. Obama’s comments were “not entirely conducive to the good of that cause,” he said.Johnson Under Fire for Controversial Comments (10 a.m.)Boris Johnson said the quotation of comments from his newspaper columns about Muslims, black people and single mothers were a “distortion” of his true views. In a 1995 article republished this week, he blamed single mothers for “producing a generation of ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate children.”“These are 25 year old quotations culled from articles written before I was even in politics,” Johnson said in response to an angry call from a single mother to a phone-in on LBC. “Almost invariably when you look at these articles what the actual piece is saying the opposite of what is claimed.” Johnson also refused to say how many children he has and whether he is involved in all of their lives.The description of single mothers was not the first time Johnson’s comments have attracted condemnation. He has previously come under fire for referring to black people as “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles,” while last year he used the terms “bank robber” and “letterbox” to describe Muslim women who wear burqas.Johnson also refused to say whether Jacob Rees-Mogg would still be in his cabinet if he wins the election after the leader of the House of Commons suggested people could have survived the Grenfell Tower fire if they’d shown “common sense” to escape. “I’m not going to get into measuring up the curtains type conversations,” Johnson said.Johnson Defends Tory Plans on NHS (9:40 a.m.)During his Q&A appearance on LBC radio, Boris Johnson was repeatedly challenged on his Conservative Party’s plans for the National Health Service. He acknowledged that a pledge to add 50,000 nurses actually includes persuading 19,000 to stay in the profession -- a discrepancy that opposition parties have said shows the Tories are misleading voters.“I do understand the controversy about this,” Johnson said, referring to the 19,000 figure. “The risk is that they will leave the profession and we’re putting in the funds to ensure they will stay.”Britain’s beloved state-run NHS is a key battleground in the election campaign after Labour accused Johnson of using it as a bargaining chip in talks with the U.S. on a post-Brexit trade deal. The prime minister reiterated on Friday that’s not the case, calling it “Bermuda Triangle stuff” from Corbyn’s party.Johnson was also on the back foot over his widely disputed plan to build 40 new hospitals, with opposition parties arguing the real number is only six. The prime minister was forced to acknowledge that some voters will not regard hospital refurbishments and upgrades as new hospitals. He also said the Conservative manifesto does not include a plan to resolve the crisis in social care because the precise details have not been “thrashed out” -- despite it being a key pledge in his first speech as prime minister.Johnson: Working on ‘About a Dozen’ Trade Deals (9:15 a.m.)Boris Johnson could not give a figure for how many trade deals the U.K. has ready ahead of its departure from the EU. “I can’t give the answer to how many deals are actually formalized,” he said in a phone-in with listeners on LBC radio. “There are a number that are virtually ready to go.”“I imagine we have about a dozen we’re currently working on,” he said, naming China, India, New Zealand and Australia as examples.If his Conservative Party wins a working majority, the U.K. will leave the EU on Jan. 31, Johnson said. A trade deal will also be agreed with the bloc by the end of 2020, he said: “I see no reason to go beyond that deadline,” he told listeners.Williamson Denies Tory Threat to Channel 4 (9 a.m.)Education Secretary Gavin Williamson denied the Conservative Party is threatening to review Channel 4’s broadcasting license following its decision not to allow Cabinet minister Michael Gove to sub in for Boris Johnson in a leaders’ debate on climate change on Thursday.Speaking on BBC radio, Williamson said the party has raised a complaint with the broadcasting regulator Ofcom. The row came after Johnson declined to appear in the debate, sending Gove in his place. Channel 4 refused to allow Gove, who appeared at the venue with his own television crew, to take part -- on the basis that the invitation was to the leaders of the political parties.“The Conservative Party isn’t threatening Channel 4, we’re raising a complaint with Ofcom which is perfectly legitimate,” Williamson said. “Frankly they reduced the quality of the debate that happened yesterday by refusing to let Michael Gove go on.” The Telegraph cited a source in the Tory party it didn’t identify as saying Channel 4’s public broadcasting license is under threat.McDonnell: Johnson ‘Running Scared’ (Earlier)Labour economy spokesman John McDonnell said Boris Johnson is “running scared” from scrutiny after the prime minister refused to attend a leaders debate on climate change on Thursday evening. He has also refused to be interviewed by Andrew Neil, who has the reputation of being one of the BBC’s most forensic interviewers.“The reason he is doing it is because he thinks like, you know, his Bullingdon Club friends, that they’re above the rest of us,” McDonnell said. “Because he knows that Andrew Neil will take him apart. He’s running scared. But even if he does it now, he’s played you because he’s pushing it later and later beyond the postal vote returns.”The Conservatives wrote to OfCom, the media regulator, on Thursday evening to complain that Channel 4, the host of the climate debate, had replaced Johnson with a melting ice sculpture during the debate.Labour is not changing its strategy, McDonnell said, denying reports that the party is switching its focus to leave voting areas after polling showed that it was set to lose seats in its north of England hearltlands.Earlier:The Tories Secretly Fear Trump Could Wreck Johnson’s ElectionU.K. Consumer Confidence Lowest Heading Into Election Since 2010Johnson Warns Against Complacency Over Lead: U.K. Campaign TrailTories Riled After Iceblock Replaces U.K. PM in Climate Debate&#92;--With assistance from Alex Morales, Stuart Biggs, Eddie Spence and Kitty Donaldson.To contact the reporters on this story: Greg Ritchie in London at gritchie10@bloomberg.net;Jessica Shankleman in London at jshankleman@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Thomas PennyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","description":"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our Brexit Bulletin, follow us @Brexit and subscribe to our podcast.Two people were killed in a terrorist attack in the heart of London on Friday.

She said she expects police cordons to remain in the area “for some time.”Dick said the attack started at Fishmonger’s Hall, a livery company building on the north side of London Bridge, and said members of the public had shown “extraordinary courage stepping in to tackle this attacker.”U.K. Police Confirm Two Dead (8:15 p.m.)U.K. police confirmed two members of the public died in the terror attack on London Bridge. “As well as the suspect, who was shot dead by police, two of those injured in this attack in the London Bridge area have tragically lost their lives,” Cressida Dick, Metropolitan Police commissioner, said in a statement outside the London police service’s headquarters.“My heart goes out to their loved ones and to the three further injured victims who I understand are being treated at hospital,” she said. “The empty ideology of terror offers nothing but terror and today I urge everybody to reject that.”Johnson Cancels Saturday Campaign Events (7:50 p.m.)Prime Minister Boris Johnson canceled his planned events for campaigning in the election on Saturday, a Tory official said. He will focus instead on the government’s response to the London Bridge attack.The premier will lead a meeting of the government’s emergency “Cobra” committee at 9:30 p.m., his office said. He called Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to discuss the incident earlier on Friday.Labour Suspends London Campaigning (6:50 p.m.)Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn suspended his party’s campaigning in London for Friday evening as he called on the U.K.’s “democratic process not to be derailed by terror.”“We are suspending campaigning in London tonight as a mark of respect for those who suffered in this attack,” Corbyn said in an emailed statement. “We will not be cowed by those who threaten us. We must and we will stand together to reject hatred and division.”Earlier Conservative leader Boris Johnson suspended his own campaigning for Friday evening.Two People Dead After Attack: BBC (6:36 p.m.)Two members of the public have died after the London Bridge attack, the BBC reported, citing a government source.Earlier the police said several people had been injured during the stabbing at a premises near London Bridge. A spokeswoman for the Met Police was unable to confirm the report.Johnson Praises Civilians Who Stopped Attacker (5:45 p.m.)Boris Johnson vowed to bring all involved in the attack to justice, promising the U.K. will not be intimidated by terrorism.“Anybody involved in this crime and these attacks will be hunted down and will be brought to justice,” Johnson said in a pooled TV clip. “This country will never be cowed or divided or intimidated by this sort of attack, and our values -- our British values -- will prevail.”Johnson said he would stop his own campaigning this evening and he would be reviewing the matter in the next few hours. In the middle of the 2017 election, campaigning was suspended across all parties after a terrorist attack.“I urge everyone to be vigilant and one cannot help but think back to what happened in 2017 in a similar part of the city, and I hope people as fast as possible will be able to go back to their business,” he said.Mayor Urges Londoners to ‘Stand Resolute’ (4:55 p.m.)Mayor of London Sadiq Khan called on his city to “stand united and resolute in the face of terror” in the aftermath of the “cowardly and evil” attack.Khan praised the “breathtaking heroism from members of the public who literally ran towards the danger, not knowing what confronted them.” he said they didn’t know the bomb strapped to the suspect was a hoax. “They really are the best of us, another example of the bravery and heroism of ordinary Londoners running towards danger, risking their own personal safety to try and save others,” he said.“I’m mayor of the greatest city in the world -- one of our strengths is our diversity,” he told journalists outside the Metropolitan Police headquarters. “We do know there are people out there who hate our diversity, who hate what we stand for and are trying to seek to divide us.”Khan said the attack on London Bridge “appeared to be an isolated incident,” and the police aren’t looking for any other suspects.Trump Pledges Support to U.K. (4:40 p.m.)U.S. President Donald Trump condemned the violence on London Bridge and offered his country’s full support, a spokesman said.“President Trump has been briefed on this morning’s attack at the London Bridge and is monitoring the situation,” said Judd Deere, deputy press secretary at the White House. “The United States strongly condemns all horrific acts of violence on innocent people, and we pledge our full support to our Ally, the United Kingdom.”Trump is due to visit the U.K. next week for a NATO summit.Police: London Bridge Attack Was Terrorism (4:24 p.m.)U.K. police confirmed they had shot dead one male suspect and declared the attack a terrorist incident. “I’m now in a position to confirm that it has been declared a terrorist incident,” said Neil Basu, Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner, in a statement outside the London police service’s headquarters. “I must stress we retain an open mind as to any motive. It would be inappropriate to speculate further at this time.”He added the police believe the item strapped to the body of the suspect was a hoax explosive device.Police Ordered Diners to Flee (4 p.m.)The streets around London Bridge were locked down and armed police cleared restaurants and shops in the area. Officers are treating the incident as terror-related “as a precaution,” although the circumstances are still unclear, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.During the incident on Friday, armed officers burst into restaurants in the Borough Market area at London Bridge and urged diners to leave as fast as possible. They shouted “Out, out, out,” to people at the Black and Blue bar. Diners walked away with their hands on their heads. Nearby, police shouted to pedestrians to “run.”Officers closed off the bridge and evacuated passers-by from the surrounding area. On the north bank of the River Thames, police officers shouted to pedestrians to move back from the bridge 100 meters, and then urged them to take shelter in any nearby building, shouting: “Move inside for your own safety.”Incident Revives Memories of 2017 Attack (3:45 p.m.)The same area of London was the scene of a terrorist attack just a few days before the general election in June 2017 in which eight people were killed and 48 injured. Three Islamist terrorists drove a van at pedestrians on the bridge before arming themselves with knives and running into Borough Market, where they stabbed people in restaurants and pubs. Armed police responded and killed the attackers.Johnson returning to Central London (3:35 p.m.)Boris Johnson is returning to his office in central London after police shot a man at London Bridge and a number of people were injured.“The prime minister is on his way back to No 10 from his constituency where he will receive further updates on the London Bridge incident,” Johnson’s spokesman James Slack said in a statement.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also expressed his concern. “Shocking reports from London Bridge. My thoughts are with those caught up in the incident. Thank you to the police and emergency services who are responding,” he said on Twitter.Johnson Being Kept Updated on London Incident (3:10 p.m.)Boris Johnson said he’s being kept informed about the unfolding incident at London Bridge, in which there have been reports of gunshots and stabbings. Police said they are “currently responding to this incident as though it is terror-related.”Armed police locked down the bridge and evacuated the area. The Metropolitan Police said in a statement that after being called to a stabbing at a premises nearby, they had detained one man. A number of people have been injured, they said.“I’m being kept updated on the incident at London Bridge and want to thank the police and all emergency services for their immediate response,” Johnson said on Twitter.Home Secretary Priti Patel also posted on Twitter, saying she’s “very concerned by ongoing incident at London Bridge. My thoughts are with all affected.” She urged people to follow the advice of the police. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he’s in “close contact” with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner.Corbyn in Fresh Attack on Billionaires (12:45 p.m.)Jeremy Corbyn opened a new broadside on billionaires opposing his plans for a re-distributive socialist economy after The Daily Mail and General Trust bought the i newspaper in a 50 million pound deal ($64.5 million).“Two billionaire press barons now own half of the top 10 daily newspapers,” Corbyn said in a posting on Twitter. “Remember this when they attack Labour’s plan to make the super-rich pay their fair share.”“We are committed to preserving its distinctive, high quality and politically independent editorial style,” DMGT said in a statement on its acquisition of the i newspaper.Free Trade Group Attacks State Aid Proposals (12:20 p.m.)The Adam Smith Institute, a think tank aimed at promoting free trade which had close links with former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said it was disappointed with Boris Johnson’s plan to change state aid rules and procurement provisions to make it easier to support British companies, calling it a “form of Trumpian protectionism.”“We shouldn’t free ourselves from the European Union in order to just enslave ourselves to the whims of Whitehall,” said Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute. “Making a profit is a proof of the value added to society, and there must be no business that is too big to fail.”Tories Pledge Tougher Foreign Takeover Rules (12:05 p.m.)The Conservatives plan to strengthen protections against foreign takeovers of British companies, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said, in answer to a question about Chinese investment in the U.K.“We certainly don’t believe that the current provisions which are in place are robust enough,” Gove said at a press conference. He said he’s undertaken to “strengthen” a unit in his department that examines foreign takeovers, and “strengthen protections in the future.”Speaking alongside him, Boris Johnson agreed, before saying the country must strike a “balance” between “continuing to be open to investment from China” and making sure the U.K. doesn’t do anything “that prejudices our critical national infrastructure, our security, or do anything that would compromise our ability to cooperate with five-eyes security partners.”“Those are the parameters,” Johnson said. “I am very, very far from a Sinophobe. I want to have good relations with China, but there are clear difficulties and clear boundaries that we have to set.”U.K.’s No-Deal Preparations to Continue (12 p.m.)Boris Johnson confirmed the U.K. will continue to make preparations for a disorderly exit from the European Union. “Of course the preparations will remain extant,” he said. “There’s no reason to dismantle them.”He described the preparations which he put in place prior to the Oct. 31 deadline as being “thoroughly useful” in achieving the deal made with the EU, as it convinced Brussels the U.K. was “in earnest” about leaving.Johnson said he is confident of completing a deal with the EU by the end of 2020 and “sees no reason” to extend that deadline, meaning the U.K. crashing out without a deal is still a possibility.State Aid Plan Compatible With EU: Johnson (11:50 a.m.)Taking questions from the press after his speech, Boris Johnson said that “of course” the U.K.’s new state aid rules (see 11:35 a.m.) would be compatible with those of the European Union, dismissing the idea that they could endanger a new free trade deal with the bloc.“Were there to be any issues arising, then as you know, under any big free trade deal, there’s a joint committee to arbitrate on whether some unfair subsidy or dispensation has been made,” Johnson said. “But it would be a committee of sovereign equals.”Johnson later said he believed in competition and in a “level playing field.”Tories Vow to Change Public Procurement (11:40 a.m)The Tories vowed to break away from EU state aid rules that the party said have a “chilling effect” on government support for industry, because of the need to wait for “months or years” for decisions on whether measures by member states are permissible or not.Existing rules “mean that the U.K. government cannot take steps to quickly and effectively help companies that are in danger,” the Conservative Party said in the statement. New rules will be developed in consultation with British businesses, it said.The Tories promised a new state aid system that sets out clear principles when the government will intervene, based on the U.K.’s needs. Ministers will have “more discretion” over decisions, which they will be able to take within “days.” A new government body would be set up to manage the system, the party said.On public procurement, the Tories pledged to ditch “absurdly complex” EU rules with their “pointless tendering requirements.” It also promised “simpler and cheaper” regulations that are “geared towards supporting local business and promoting British business.” The new system will be in place by Jan. 2021.Tories Announce State Aid Plans (11:35 a.m.)The Conservatives unveiled a package of measures that they described as “immediate steps to realize the benefits of Brexit,” including a pledge to overhaul the country’s state aid system to make it “faster and easier for the government to intervene to protect jobs when an industry is in trouble.”A Tory government will also change public procurement policy to support local businesses and promote a “buy British” approach for public bodies that purchase food, in an effort to back farmers, the party said in an email.“People voted to take back control -- and we want to deliver that change,” Johnson said in a statement. “One of the crucial ways we will do that is by improving our rules so that we can back British businesses and unleash their true potential.”Stuart Tells Labour Voters to Back Johnson (11:30 a.m.)Gisela Stuart, the former Labour MP who helped run the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum, urged traditional Labour voters to back the Conservatives in what she called the Dec. 12 “Brexit election.”“Voting for Brexit this time does not make me a Tory now or in the future,” Stuart said as she stood alongside Johnson and Michael Gove. “Rather, it is the best option.”Labour Step Up Pressure Over Johnson Comments (10:40 a.m.)Labour criticized Prime Minister Boris Johnson over past remarks he made about single mothers in a column from the 1990s (See 10 a.m.)“Boris Johnson’s refusal to apologize for his hateful comments about single mothers, their children and working class men is an absolute disgrace,” Labour’s education spokeswoman, Angela Rayner, who has herself been a single mother, said in a statement. “He tried to deny what he wrote, but the evidence is there in black and white for us all to see, proving once again that he’s a liar as well as a sexist.”Johnson Signals to Trump to Stay Quiet (10:15 a.m.)Ahead of Donald Trump’s visit to the U.K. next week, Boris Johnson said the two allies “traditionally” do not get involved in each others’ domestic politics -- an apparent signal to the U.S. president not to say anything that could potentially undermine the Conservative Party’s election campaign.“We have very close relationships with the United States at every level of government, but what we don’t do traditionally -- as loving allies and friends -- is get involved in each other’s election campaigns,” Johnson told LBC radio.The comment comes amid Tory party fears of an intervention by the president in the run-up to the Dec. 12 vote. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is using Johnson’s links to the president and pursuit of a post-Brexit U.S. trade as a central attack line in the campaign, especially on the potential dangers to Britain’s state-run National Health Service.Johnson pointed out that former President Barack Obama’s intervention in the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign didn’t help the government’s argument for staying in the European Union. Obama’s comments were “not entirely conducive to the good of that cause,” he said.Johnson Under Fire for Controversial Comments (10 a.m.)Boris Johnson said the quotation of comments from his newspaper columns about Muslims, black people and single mothers were a “distortion” of his true views. In a 1995 article republished this week, he blamed single mothers for “producing a generation of ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate children.”“These are 25 year old quotations culled from articles written before I was even in politics,” Johnson said in response to an angry call from a single mother to a phone-in on LBC. “Almost invariably when you look at these articles what the actual piece is saying the opposite of what is claimed.” Johnson also refused to say how many children he has and whether he is involved in all of their lives.The description of single mothers was not the first time Johnson’s comments have attracted condemnation. He has previously come under fire for referring to black people as “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles,” while last year he used the terms “bank robber” and “letterbox” to describe Muslim women who wear burqas.Johnson also refused to say whether Jacob Rees-Mogg would still be in his cabinet if he wins the election after the leader of the House of Commons suggested people could have survived the Grenfell Tower fire if they’d shown “common sense” to escape. “I’m not going to get into measuring up the curtains type conversations,” Johnson said.Johnson Defends Tory Plans on NHS (9:40 a.m.)During his Q&A appearance on LBC radio, Boris Johnson was repeatedly challenged on his Conservative Party’s plans for the National Health Service. He acknowledged that a pledge to add 50,000 nurses actually includes persuading 19,000 to stay in the profession -- a discrepancy that opposition parties have said shows the Tories are misleading voters.“I do understand the controversy about this,” Johnson said, referring to the 19,000 figure. “The risk is that they will leave the profession and we’re putting in the funds to ensure they will stay.”Britain’s beloved state-run NHS is a key battleground in the election campaign after Labour accused Johnson of using it as a bargaining chip in talks with the U.S. on a post-Brexit trade deal. The prime minister reiterated on Friday that’s not the case, calling it “Bermuda Triangle stuff” from Corbyn’s party.Johnson was also on the back foot over his widely disputed plan to build 40 new hospitals, with opposition parties arguing the real number is only six. The prime minister was forced to acknowledge that some voters will not regard hospital refurbishments and upgrades as new hospitals. He also said the Conservative manifesto does not include a plan to resolve the crisis in social care because the precise details have not been “thrashed out” -- despite it being a key pledge in his first speech as prime minister.Johnson: Working on ‘About a Dozen’ Trade Deals (9:15 a.m.)Boris Johnson could not give a figure for how many trade deals the U.K. has ready ahead of its departure from the EU. “I can’t give the answer to how many deals are actually formalized,” he said in a phone-in with listeners on LBC radio. “There are a number that are virtually ready to go.”“I imagine we have about a dozen we’re currently working on,” he said, naming China, India, New Zealand and Australia as examples.If his Conservative Party wins a working majority, the U.K. will leave the EU on Jan. 31, Johnson said. A trade deal will also be agreed with the bloc by the end of 2020, he said: “I see no reason to go beyond that deadline,” he told listeners.Williamson Denies Tory Threat to Channel 4 (9 a.m.)Education Secretary Gavin Williamson denied the Conservative Party is threatening to review Channel 4’s broadcasting license following its decision not to allow Cabinet minister Michael Gove to sub in for Boris Johnson in a leaders’ debate on climate change on Thursday.Speaking on BBC radio, Williamson said the party has raised a complaint with the broadcasting regulator Ofcom. The row came after Johnson declined to appear in the debate, sending Gove in his place. Channel 4 refused to allow Gove, who appeared at the venue with his own television crew, to take part -- on the basis that the invitation was to the leaders of the political parties.“The Conservative Party isn’t threatening Channel 4, we’re raising a complaint with Ofcom which is perfectly legitimate,” Williamson said. “Frankly they reduced the quality of the debate that happened yesterday by refusing to let Michael Gove go on.” The Telegraph cited a source in the Tory party it didn’t identify as saying Channel 4’s public broadcasting license is under threat.McDonnell: Johnson ‘Running Scared’ (Earlier)Labour economy spokesman John McDonnell said Boris Johnson is “running scared” from scrutiny after the prime minister refused to attend a leaders debate on climate change on Thursday evening. He has also refused to be interviewed by Andrew Neil, who has the reputation of being one of the BBC’s most forensic interviewers.“The reason he is doing it is because he thinks like, you know, his Bullingdon Club friends, that they’re above the rest of us,” McDonnell said. “Because he knows that Andrew Neil will take him apart. He’s running scared. But even if he does it now, he’s played you because he’s pushing it later and later beyond the postal vote returns.”The Conservatives wrote to OfCom, the media regulator, on Thursday evening to complain that Channel 4, the host of the climate debate, had replaced Johnson with a melting ice sculpture during the debate.Labour is not changing its strategy, McDonnell said, denying reports that the party is switching its focus to leave voting areas after polling showed that it was set to lose seats in its north of England hearltlands.Earlier:The Tories Secretly Fear Trump Could Wreck Johnson’s ElectionU.K. Consumer Confidence Lowest Heading Into Election Since 2010Johnson Warns Against Complacency Over Lead: U.K. Campaign TrailTories Riled After Iceblock Replaces U.K. PM in Climate Debate&#92;--With assistance from Alex Morales, Stuart Biggs, Eddie Spence and Kitty Donaldson.To contact the reporters on this story: Greg Ritchie in London at gritchie10@bloomberg.net;Jessica Shankleman in London at jshankleman@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Thomas PennyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https://news.yahoo.com/johnson-warns-against-complacency-over-090218226.html","date":"2019-11-29T20:40:01.000Z","id":639},"640":{"title":"Suddenly, the Chinese Threat to Australia Seems Very Real","summary":"CANBERRA, Australia -- A Chinese defector to Australia who detailed political interference by Beijing. A businessman found dead after telling the authorities about a Chinese plot to install him in Parliament. Suspicious men following critics of Beijing in major Australian cities.For a country that just wants calm commerce with China -- the propellant behind 28 years of steady growth -- the revelations of the past week have delivered a jolt.Fears of Chinese interference once seemed to hover indistinctly over Australia. Now, Beijing&#39;s political ambitions, and the espionage operations that further them, suddenly feel local, concrete and ever-present.&quot;It&#39;s become the inescapable issue,&quot; said Hugh White, a former intelligence official who teaches strategic studies at the Australian National University. &quot;We&#39;ve underestimated how quickly China&#39;s power has grown along with its ambition to use that power.&quot;U.S. officials often describe Australia as a test case, the ally close enough to Beijing to see what could be coming for others.In public and in private, they&#39;ve pushed Australia&#39;s leaders to confront China more directly -- pressure that may only grow after President Donald Trump signed legislation to impose sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials over human rights abuses in Hong Kong.Even as it confronts the specter of brazen espionage, Australia&#39;s government has yet to draw clear boundaries for an autocratic giant that is both an economic partner and a threat to freedom -- a conundrum faced by many countries, but more acutely by Australia.Prime Minister Scott Morrison continues to insist that Australia need not choose between China and the United States. A new foreign interference law has barely been enforced, and secrecy is so ingrained that even lawmakers and experts lack the in-depth information they need.As a result, the country&#39;s intelligence agencies have raised alarms about China in ways that most Australian politicians avoid. The agencies have never been flush with expertise on China, including Chinese speakers, yet they are now in charge of disentangling complex claims of nefarious deeds, all vigorously denied by China.In the most troubling recent case, first reported by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, the Australian authorities have confirmed that they are investigating accusations made by Nick Zhao, an Australian businessman who told intelligence officials that he had been the target of a plot to install him in Parliament as a Chinese agent.Zhao, a 32-year-old luxury car dealer, was a member of his local Liberal Party branch. He was a &quot;perfect target for cultivation,&quot; according to Andrew Hastie, a federal lawmaker and tough critic of Beijing who was briefed on the case. He told The Age that Zhao was &quot;a bit of a high-roller in Melbourne, living beyond his means.&quot;Another businessman with ties to the Chinese government, Zhao said, offered to provide 1 million Australian dollars ($677,000) to finance his election campaign for Parliament. But a few months later, in March, Zhao was found dead in a hotel room. The state&#39;s coroner is investigating the cause of death.In a rare statement, Mike Burgess, the head of Australia&#39;s domestic spy agency, said Monday that his organization was aware of Zhao&#39;s case and was taking it very seriously.The Chinese government, however, called the accusations a sign of Australian hysteria.&quot;Stories like &#39;Chinese espionage&#39; or &#39;China&#39;s infiltration in Australia,&#39; with however bizarre plots and eye-catching details, are nothing but lies,&quot; the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said at a regular news briefing Monday.Beijing has similarly dismissed the case that emerged last week, which involves a young asylum-seeker named Wang Liqiang.Wang presented himself to the Australian authorities as an important intelligence asset -- an assistant to a Hong Kong businessman who Wang says is responsible for spying, propaganda and disinformation campaigns aimed at quashing dissent in Hong Kong and undermining democracy in Taiwan.China asserts that he is simply a convicted swindler. On Thursday, a Communist Party tabloid, The Global Times, released video of what it said was Wang&#39;s 2016 trial on fraud charges, where a young man confessed to bilking someone out of $17,000.Xiang Xin, the man Wang identified as his former boss, has denied having anything to do with him, or even knowing him.The challenge of the case is just beginning. While some analysts have raised doubts about Wang&#39;s assertions, elements in the detailed 17-page account that he gave to the authorities as part of an asylum application are being taken seriously by law enforcement agencies worldwide.Taiwan&#39;s Ministry of Justice detained Xiang and another executive with the company Wang said he worked for, China Innovation Investment Limited. Investigators in Taiwan are looking into assertions that their business acted on behalf of Chinese intelligence agencies.Other details in Wang&#39;s account -- about the kidnapping of booksellers in Hong Kong, spying on Hong Kong university students, and the theft of military technology from the United States -- are still being examined by Australian officials.&quot;Australia&#39;s peak intelligence agencies are being put to the test,&quot; said John Fitzgerald, a China specialist at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne. &quot;It&#39;s a tough call, and they cannot afford to get it wrong.&quot;What&#39;s clear, though, is that they are helping to push the public away from supporting cozy relations. Polls showed a hardening of Australian attitudes about China even before the past week.Now Hastie, the China hawk and Liberal Party lawmaker who chairs Parliament&#39;s joint intelligence committee, says his office has been overwhelmed by people across the country who have emailed, called and even sent handwritten letters expressing outrage and anxiety about China&#39;s actions in Australia.Questions of loyalty continue to swirl around another Liberal Party member of Parliament, Gladys Liu, who fumbled responses to questions in September about her membership in various groups linked to the Chinese Communist Party.The espionage cases also follow several months of rising tensions at Australian universities, where protests by students from Hong Kong have been disrupted, sometimes with violence, by opponents from the Chinese mainland.Several student activists have told the authorities that they have been followed or photographed by people who appear to be associated with the Chinese Consulate.It&#39;s even happened to at least one high-profile former official, John Garnaut. A longtime journalist who produced a classified report on Chinese interference for former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2017, he recently acknowledged publicly that he had been stalked by people who appeared to be Chinese agents -- in some cases when he was with his family.These actions of apparent aggression point to a version of China that Australians hardly know. For decades, Australia has based its relations with Beijing on a simple idea: Let&#39;s get rich together. And the mining companies that are especially close to Morrison&#39;s conservative government have been the biggest winners.But now more than ever, the country is seeing that for the Communist Party under President Xi Jinping, it&#39;s no longer just about wealth and trade.&quot;The transactions aren&#39;t satisfying them enough; they want more,&quot; said John Blaxland, a professor of international security and intelligence studies at the Australian National University. &quot;They want to gain influence over decisions about the further involvement of the United States, about further protestations to Chinese actions in the South China Sea, in the South Pacific, in Taiwan.&quot;Blaxland, along with U.S. officials, often points out that Australia&#39;s biggest export to China, iron ore, is hard to obtain elsewhere reliably and at the prices Australia&#39;s companies charge. That suggests that the country has more leverage than its leaders might think.Hastie, who was recently denied a visa to travel to China as part of a study group that included other members of Parliament, agreed. In an interview, he said the recent revelations were &quot;the first time the Australian public has a concrete example of what we are facing.&quot;Now, he added, it&#39;s time to adapt.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company","description":"CANBERRA, Australia -- A Chinese defector to Australia who detailed political interference by Beijing.

While some analysts have raised doubts about Wang&#39;s assertions, elements in the detailed 17-page account that he gave to the authorities as part of an asylum application are being taken seriously by law enforcement agencies worldwide.Taiwan&#39;s Ministry of Justice detained Xiang and another executive with the company Wang said he worked for, China Innovation Investment Limited. Investigators in Taiwan are looking into assertions that their business acted on behalf of Chinese intelligence agencies.Other details in Wang&#39;s account -- about the kidnapping of booksellers in Hong Kong, spying on Hong Kong university students, and the theft of military technology from the United States -- are still being examined by Australian officials.&quot;Australia&#39;s peak intelligence agencies are being put to the test,&quot; said John Fitzgerald, a China specialist at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne. &quot;It&#39;s a tough call, and they cannot afford to get it wrong.&quot;What&#39;s clear, though, is that they are helping to push the public away from supporting cozy relations. Polls showed a hardening of Australian attitudes about China even before the past week.Now Hastie, the China hawk and Liberal Party lawmaker who chairs Parliament&#39;s joint intelligence committee, says his office has been overwhelmed by people across the country who have emailed, called and even sent handwritten letters expressing outrage and anxiety about China&#39;s actions in Australia.Questions of loyalty continue to swirl around another Liberal Party member of Parliament, Gladys Liu, who fumbled responses to questions in September about her membership in various groups linked to the Chinese Communist Party.The espionage cases also follow several months of rising tensions at Australian universities, where protests by students from Hong Kong have been disrupted, sometimes with violence, by opponents from the Chinese mainland.Several student activists have told the authorities that they have been followed or photographed by people who appear to be associated with the Chinese Consulate.It&#39;s even happened to at least one high-profile former official, John Garnaut. A longtime journalist who produced a classified report on Chinese interference for former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2017, he recently acknowledged publicly that he had been stalked by people who appeared to be Chinese agents -- in some cases when he was with his family.These actions of apparent aggression point to a version of China that Australians hardly know. For decades, Australia has based its relations with Beijing on a simple idea: Let&#39;s get rich together. And the mining companies that are especially close to Morrison&#39;s conservative government have been the biggest winners.But now more than ever, the country is seeing that for the Communist Party under President Xi Jinping, it&#39;s no longer just about wealth and trade.&quot;The transactions aren&#39;t satisfying them enough; they want more,&quot; said John Blaxland, a professor of international security and intelligence studies at the Australian National University. &quot;They want to gain influence over decisions about the further involvement of the United States, about further protestations to Chinese actions in the South China Sea, in the South Pacific, in Taiwan.&quot;Blaxland, along with U.S. officials, often points out that Australia&#39;s biggest export to China, iron ore, is hard to obtain elsewhere reliably and at the prices Australia&#39;s companies charge. That suggests that the country has more leverage than its leaders might think.Hastie, who was recently denied a visa to travel to China as part of a study group that included other members of Parliament, agreed. In an interview, he said the recent revelations were &quot;the first time the Australian public has a concrete example of what we are facing.&quot;Now, he added, it&#39;s time to adapt.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company","url":"https://news.yahoo.com/suddenly-chinese-threat-australia-seems-200729947.html","date":"2019-11-29T20:07:29.000Z","id":640},"641":{"title":"INSIGHT-Threats, arrests, targeted killings silence Iraqi dissidents","summary":"After armed men raided the home of Hussein Adel al-Madani  and his wife Sara Talib last year, the Iraqi activists spent months of self-imposed exile in Turkey, changed address upon returning home and ceased participating in protests, according to two friends of the couple.

[The Associated Press] 2.Police restored school administrators&#39; control of Hong Kong Polytechnic University on Friday, declaring that there were no pro-democracy protesters left on the wrecked campus after a two-week siege. Police arrested hundreds of protesters during the showdown. On Thursday, a team of about 400 officers conducted a sweep of the university, and found nearly 4,000 firebombs, 921 gas canisters, and 588 containers of chemicals, including acid and other corrosive liquids. The transfer of control back to school officials marked the end of one of the most intense clashes between protesters and police in a month of escalating unrest following the death of a student who fell from a parking structure during a police operation. [The New York Times, South China Morning Post] 3.North Korea on Thursday launched two short-range projectiles into the waters off its east coast, South Korea&#39;s military said. &quot;Our military expresses its strong regret over (the launches) and urges (North Korea) to immediately stop acts that escalate military tensions,&quot; said Maj. Gen. Jeon Dong Jin, a senior operations officer at Seoul&#39;s Joint Chiefs of Staff. The missile test came three days after North Korea said its soldiers had held artillery drills near a disputed sea boundary. The latest missile launches were the 13th public weapons test conducted by North Korea this year as Pyongyang pushes for a new U.S. proposal to resume stalled talks on trading nuclear concessions for sanctions relief. [The Associated Press, The Washington Post] 4.The European Parliament on Thursday passed a symbolic measure declaring a &quot;climate emergency.&quot; The move raises pressure on member states to take action to curb emissions blamed for climate change ahead of a United Nations climate summit starting Dec. 2 in Spain. In recent months, hundreds of regional and local administrations have approved similar declarations, but Thursday&#39;s vote was significant because the European lawmakers who passed the measure represent 500 million people. &quot;Five years ago, no one would have expected the European Parliament to declare a climate emergency, so there&#39;s some progress,&quot; said Sebastian Mang of Greenpeace. Dissenters in the 429-225 vote objected to the use of the word &quot;emergency,&quot; suggesting the use of &quot;urgency&quot; instead. [The Washington Post, Reuters] 5.The holiday shopping season kicks off on Friday with traditional Black Friday sales. Many retailers got a jump on the competition by getting started with deep discounts on Thanksgiving Day, and analysts forecast data to show that online shoppers spent a record $4 billion on Thanksgiving. The total had already reached $2.1 billion as of 5 p.m. Thursday, a 20.2 percent increase compared to the same point last year. Demand was so high on Thursday that Costco&#39;s website and app were briefly hampered by heavy traffic. Black Friday is continuing to evolve, as many stores try to snag a bigger share of holiday sales by cutting prices days or even weeks before what used to be a one-day shopping frenzy. Shoppers are expected to spend up to $731 billion in November and December, roughly 4 percent more than in the same period last year. [USA Today, MarketWatch] 6.Powerful winter storms hammered parts of the country on Thursday, complicating Thanksgiving travel. Heavy snow forced the closure of Interstate 5, a major highway in Southern California, leaving dozens of vehicles stuck with snow still falling. The highway, which joins Southern California with the rest of the state, was reopened later in the day, but forecasters warned more snow and rain could fall in the area. A so-called bomb cyclone, with a rapid drop in atmospheric pressure, brought up to four feet of snow in some mountainous areas in the Pacific Northwest. The winter storm was expected to move east, bringing snow and high winds across much of the West before continuing toward the Great Plains late on Friday. [Reuters] 7.Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a key witness in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump, on Thursday reiterated his denial of sexual misconduct allegations made by three women in an article jointly published Wednesday by ProPublica and Portland Monthly magazine. In the article, Sondland said the claims were &quot;concocted&quot; for &quot;political purposes.&quot; One of the women said Sondland backtracked on plans to invest in her business after she rejected his advances during a tour of a hotel he owns. Another accuser, a work associate, said Sondland exposed himself to her. The third, who is 27 years younger than Sondland, said he forcibly kissed her when they met to discuss a possible job. One of the accusers, Nicole Vogel, owns Portland Monthly. The alleged incidents took place years ago, before Sondland was named as Trump&#39;s E.U. ambassador. [The Wall Street Journal, ProPublica] 8.Thousands of demonstrators rallied in Hong Kong on Thursday to express appreciation for two U.S. laws supporting human rights in the Chinese-ruled semi-autonomous city. President Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act on Wednesday. It requires an annual review to confirm that the former British colony still has enough autonomy to justify its special trade status. &quot;I guess Trump wanted to give us a Thanksgiving present, and we&#39;re glad to accept,&quot; said Wong Yiu-chung, a Lingnan University politics professor who attended the rally. Chinese officials on Thursday angrily condemned the U.S. measures as &quot;an epitome of gangster violence,&quot; and an act of foreign meddling intended to hurt China&#39;s economic growth. [Los Angeles Times] 9.Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday urged President Trump to avoid commenting on Britain&#39;s upcoming election during next week&#39;s NATO summit in London. &quot;The best (thing) when you have close friends and allies like the U.S. and the UK is for neither side to get involved in each other&#39;s election,&quot; Johnson told LBC radio. Johnson pushed for the early election hoping to break a stalemate over Britain&#39;s planned exit from the European Union. Trump has already made controversial comments in the vote, saying in October that Johnson should join forces with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and that the opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn would be &quot;so bad&quot; for the country. [Reuters] 10.Acclaimed American free-solo rock climber Brad Gobright died in a fall while on a well-known path on a rock known as El Sendero Luminoso, or the Shining Path, in northern Mexico&#39;s Potrero Chico national park, Mexican authorities said. His body was recovered Thursday. Gobright and a climbing partner, Aidan Jacobson, fell about 20 feet to a ledge after their rope got stuck, but Jacobson landed in a bush, which broke his fall. &quot;It was basically a blur,&quot; Jacobson, 26, told Outside magazine. &quot;He screamed. I screamed. I went through some vegetation, and then all I remember is seeing his blue Gramicci shirt bounce over the edge.&quot; Gobright fell nearly 985 feet to his death, which the State Department confirmed in a statement, saying, &quot;We offer our sincerest condolences to his family on their loss.&quot; [CNN, The New York Times]More stories from theweek.com  God&#39;s gift to America?

The transfer of control back to school officials marked the end of one of the most intense clashes between protesters and police in a month of escalating unrest following the death of a student who fell from a parking structure during a police operation. [The New York Times, South China Morning Post] 3.North Korea on Thursday launched two short-range projectiles into the waters off its east coast, South Korea&#39;s military said. &quot;Our military expresses its strong regret over (the launches) and urges (North Korea) to immediately stop acts that escalate military tensions,&quot; said Maj. Gen. Jeon Dong Jin, a senior operations officer at Seoul&#39;s Joint Chiefs of Staff. The missile test came three days after North Korea said its soldiers had held artillery drills near a disputed sea boundary. The latest missile launches were the 13th public weapons test conducted by North Korea this year as Pyongyang pushes for a new U.S. proposal to resume stalled talks on trading nuclear concessions for sanctions relief. [The Associated Press, The Washington Post] 4.The European Parliament on Thursday passed a symbolic measure declaring a &quot;climate emergency.&quot; The move raises pressure on member states to take action to curb emissions blamed for climate change ahead of a United Nations climate summit starting Dec. 2 in Spain. In recent months, hundreds of regional and local administrations have approved similar declarations, but Thursday&#39;s vote was significant because the European lawmakers who passed the measure represent 500 million people. &quot;Five years ago, no one would have expected the European Parliament to declare a climate emergency, so there&#39;s some progress,&quot; said Sebastian Mang of Greenpeace. Dissenters in the 429-225 vote objected to the use of the word &quot;emergency,&quot; suggesting the use of &quot;urgency&quot; instead. [The Washington Post, Reuters] 5.The holiday shopping season kicks off on Friday with traditional Black Friday sales. Many retailers got a jump on the competition by getting started with deep discounts on Thanksgiving Day, and analysts forecast data to show that online shoppers spent a record $4 billion on Thanksgiving. The total had already reached $2.1 billion as of 5 p.m. Thursday, a 20.2 percent increase compared to the same point last year. Demand was so high on Thursday that Costco&#39;s website and app were briefly hampered by heavy traffic. Black Friday is continuing to evolve, as many stores try to snag a bigger share of holiday sales by cutting prices days or even weeks before what used to be a one-day shopping frenzy. Shoppers are expected to spend up to $731 billion in November and December, roughly 4 percent more than in the same period last year. [USA Today, MarketWatch] 6.Powerful winter storms hammered parts of the country on Thursday, complicating Thanksgiving travel. Heavy snow forced the closure of Interstate 5, a major highway in Southern California, leaving dozens of vehicles stuck with snow still falling. The highway, which joins Southern California with the rest of the state, was reopened later in the day, but forecasters warned more snow and rain could fall in the area. A so-called bomb cyclone, with a rapid drop in atmospheric pressure, brought up to four feet of snow in some mountainous areas in the Pacific Northwest. The winter storm was expected to move east, bringing snow and high winds across much of the West before continuing toward the Great Plains late on Friday. [Reuters] 7.Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a key witness in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump, on Thursday reiterated his denial of sexual misconduct allegations made by three women in an article jointly published Wednesday by ProPublica and Portland Monthly magazine. In the article, Sondland said the claims were &quot;concocted&quot; for &quot;political purposes.&quot; One of the women said Sondland backtracked on plans to invest in her business after she rejected his advances during a tour of a hotel he owns. Another accuser, a work associate, said Sondland exposed himself to her. The third, who is 27 years younger than Sondland, said he forcibly kissed her when they met to discuss a possible job. One of the accusers, Nicole Vogel, owns Portland Monthly. The alleged incidents took place years ago, before Sondland was named as Trump&#39;s E.U. ambassador. [The Wall Street Journal, ProPublica] 8.Thousands of demonstrators rallied in Hong Kong on Thursday to express appreciation for two U.S. laws supporting human rights in the Chinese-ruled semi-autonomous city. President Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act on Wednesday. It requires an annual review to confirm that the former British colony still has enough autonomy to justify its special trade status. &quot;I guess Trump wanted to give us a Thanksgiving present, and we&#39;re glad to accept,&quot; said Wong Yiu-chung, a Lingnan University politics professor who attended the rally. Chinese officials on Thursday angrily condemned the U.S. measures as &quot;an epitome of gangster violence,&quot; and an act of foreign meddling intended to hurt China&#39;s economic growth. [Los Angeles Times] 9.Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday urged President Trump to avoid commenting on Britain&#39;s upcoming election during next week&#39;s NATO summit in London. &quot;The best (thing) when you have close friends and allies like the U.S. and the UK is for neither side to get involved in each other&#39;s election,&quot; Johnson told LBC radio. Johnson pushed for the early election hoping to break a stalemate over Britain&#39;s planned exit from the European Union. Trump has already made controversial comments in the vote, saying in October that Johnson should join forces with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and that the opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn would be &quot;so bad&quot; for the country. [Reuters] 10.Acclaimed American free-solo rock climber Brad Gobright died in a fall while on a well-known path on a rock known as El Sendero Luminoso, or the Shining Path, in northern Mexico&#39;s Potrero Chico national park, Mexican authorities said. His body was recovered Thursday. Gobright and a climbing partner, Aidan Jacobson, fell about 20 feet to a ledge after their rope got stuck, but Jacobson landed in a bush, which broke his fall. &quot;It was basically a blur,&quot; Jacobson, 26, told Outside magazine. &quot;He screamed. I screamed. I went through some vegetation, and then all I remember is seeing his blue Gramicci shirt bounce over the edge.&quot; Gobright fell nearly 985 feet to his death, which the State Department confirmed in a statement, saying, &quot;We offer our sincerest condolences to his family on their loss.&quot; [CNN, The New York Times]More stories from theweek.com  God&#39;s gift to America?

The bloc puts strict limits on state aid to prevent unfair competition, and has no reason to make an exception for the U.K.“We shouldn’t free ourselves from the EU in order to just enslave ourselves to the whims of Whitehall,” said Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute, a think tank aimed at promoting free trade which was closely linked to former Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. He branded Johnson’s plans a “form of Trumpian protectionism.”Despite riling some allies, the prime minister’s message on state aid and favoring British companies may help win support in Labour-held seats in England’s north and midlands he needs for a parliamentary majority. Even as opinions polls show him well on course to do so, many of these local races still look set to to be close.Deal PressureJohnson, who pledged again to leave the EU by the end of January, needs to reach a deal with the U.K.’s biggest trading partner by the time current arrangements expire at the end of next year. But the further Britain departs from the bloc’s labor, environment and state-aid standards, the harder it will be to reach an agreement that will give U.K. companies access to the European market.The Conservatives said the EU’s current state-aid rules have a “chilling effect” because governments have to wait for the European Commission to approve any measures, delaying measures “to quickly and effectively help companies that are in danger.”The Tories promised a new system that sets out clear principles for government intervention, based on the U.K.’s needs.

The bloc puts strict limits on state aid to prevent unfair competition, and has no reason to make an exception for the U.K.“We shouldn’t free ourselves from the EU in order to just enslave ourselves to the whims of Whitehall,” said Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute, a think tank aimed at promoting free trade which was closely linked to former Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. He branded Johnson’s plans a “form of Trumpian protectionism.”Despite riling some allies, the prime minister’s message on state aid and favoring British companies may help win support in Labour-held seats in England’s north and midlands he needs for a parliamentary majority. Even as opinions polls show him well on course to do so, many of these local races still look set to to be close.Deal PressureJohnson, who pledged again to leave the EU by the end of January, needs to reach a deal with the U.K.’s biggest trading partner by the time current arrangements expire at the end of next year. But the further Britain departs from the bloc’s labor, environment and state-aid standards, the harder it will be to reach an agreement that will give U.K. companies access to the European market.The Conservatives said the EU’s current state-aid rules have a “chilling effect” because governments have to wait for the European Commission to approve any measures, delaying measures “to quickly and effectively help companies that are in danger.”The Tories promised a new system that sets out clear principles for government intervention, based on the U.K.’s needs. Ministers will have “more discretion” over decisions, which they will be able to take within “days.” A new government body would be created to manage the system, the party said.Taking questions from the press after a speech in London, Johnson said that “of course” the new rules would be compatible with those of the EU, adding that, even with the new rules, he is committed to keeping a “level playing field” -- a key requirement for the bloc.‘Sovereign Equals’“Were there to be any issues arising, then as you know, under any big free trade deal, there’s a joint committee to arbitrate on whether some unfair subsidy or dispensation has been made,” Johnson said. “But it would be a committee of sovereign equals.”“I wonder when the penny will drop for that small minority who voted for Brexit because they thought it meant less red tape, lower tax, less government intervention and Britain as a ‘Singapore in the North Sea’ -- they’re getting the opposite,” former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted.The promise on takeovers follows a spate of controversial acquisitions of British companies, including defense contractor Cobham Plc and satellite operator Inmarsat Plc, by overseas bidders -- a trend fueled in part by a decline in the pound since the Brexit referendum.

[BBC, Deutsche Welle] 7.The initial public offering from Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco has drawn total bids of $44.3 billion so far from retail and institutional investors, about 1.7 times the amount the kingdom plans to reel in. The sale is on pace to be the world&#39;s largest listing when it formally prices next week. Most of the bids came from Saudi investors, however, hinting that international investors are wary about the state-owned company&#39;s valuation of $1.6 to $1.7 trillion set by the government. The Saudi government is aiming to sell a 1.5 percent stake and raise $25.6 billion, which would beat out Alibaba&#39;s $25 billion IPO in 2014. The IPO is a central part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#39;s plan to diversify the Saudi economy.

Shaw has not played for the Cardinals this season after landing on injured reserve in August following a shoulder injury. As a result, he reportedly hasn&#39;t been around the team very much during the season. The league did not find that Shaw used any inside information to bet on games or that any game was compromised. Shaw&#39;s teammates and coaches were also reportedly unaware of his gambling and were not involved. Betting on football is prohibited for anyone who works for the NFL in any capacity. Shaw is the first player to be suspended for gambling by the league in 36 years. [ESPN, CBS Sports]More stories from theweek.com  God&#39;s gift to America?

Shaw has not played for the Cardinals this season after landing on injured reserve in August following a shoulder injury. As a result, he reportedly hasn&#39;t been around the team very much during the season. The league did not find that Shaw used any inside information to bet on games or that any game was compromised. Shaw&#39;s teammates and coaches were also reportedly unaware of his gambling and were not involved. Betting on football is prohibited for anyone who works for the NFL in any capacity. Shaw is the first player to be suspended for gambling by the league in 36 years. [ESPN, CBS Sports]More stories from theweek.com  God&#39;s gift to America?

Expect all the walls, floors, ceilings and attendees’ faces to literally light up. The Cent Quatre cultural centre is where to head for cutting-edge contemporary art and live hip-hop, plus bargains from the on-site Emmaüs Défi store.

Another underappreciated panorama, this time facing Sacré-Cœur, can be found 20 minutes’ walk away, from the Temple de la Sybille folly perched 50 metres above the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont’s artificial lake.

But there’s a more hidden world of immersive art exhibitions, atmospheric arcades, floating swimming pools and edgy jazz nights to exploreExplore an under-the-radar art institutionOne art space on every trendy Parisian’s lips is the child-friendly Atelier des Lumières, a former iron foundry that hosts exquisite projection shows based on the oeuvre of a single artist – so far, it has featured Gustav Klimt and Vincent van Gogh. Expect all the walls, floors, ceilings and attendees’ faces to literally light up. The Cent Quatre cultural centre is where to head for cutting-edge contemporary art and live hip-hop, plus bargains from the on-site Emmaüs Défi store. If you’re into photography – and have a day or two to spare – the Maison Européenne de la Photographie, the Jeu de Paume and the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson make a truly world-beating trio.Survey the skylineThat lineup of magnificent sights stretching from Notre Dame to Les Invalides is best viewed not from the Eiffel Tower, but from the north-eastern Parc de Belleville. Climb up to the graffiti-clad Belvédère Willy Ronis on a weekday and chances are you’ll be the only one there. Another underappreciated panorama, this time facing Sacré-Cœur, can be found 20 minutes’ walk away, from the Temple de la Sybille folly perched 50 metres above the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont’s artificial lake. Jean Nouvel’s epic Philharmonie de Paris offers both an exemplary concert programme and photo-worthy rooftop views.

Johnson’s opponent, Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, said he didn’t agree that convicted terrorists always should serve out their full prison terms. He also accused governments of worsening the threat of such attacks and said the “war on terror has manifestly failed.”Must Read: The Tories Secretly Fear Trump Could Wreck Johnson’s ElectionFor more on the election visit ELEC.Key Developments:Johnson pledges Conservative government will make sure convicted terrorists serve their full prison sentencesJohnson plans a review of Britain’s security, defense and foreign policyLabour narrows Tory lead in four of five new opinion pollsSecurity Minister Says Hung Parliament Disrupted Tory Terror Policy (11:19 a.m.)Security minister Brandon Lewis said the government would have already started the process of stopping the early release of convicted terrorists if it wasn’t for the U.K.’s hung parliament.Speaking on BBC Radio’s “Pienaar’s Politics,” Lewis said “we’d already started making steps in that direction” but that “one of the problems with parliament being utterly frozen over Brexit” is that this kind of legislation is unable to pass.The Conservative party won a majority in parliament in 2015, before losing it in 2017 and ruling in a minority government with support from the DUP. A number of resignations and expulsions over Brexit in 2019 further hampered the party’s ability to pass its legislation further.Johnson Refuses to Take Blame for Previous Tory Policies (9:55 a.m.)Prime Minister Boris Johnson sought to distance himself from decisions made by previous Conservative governments as he appeared on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.When pushed on the record of the Tories on law and order and spending since 2010, Johnson repeatedly said he’s only been prime minister since the summer, and that previous governments had to implement “prudent” management of public finances.Johnson also said a government under him would invest more in the criminal justice system. He said about 74 convicted terrorists have been released early, and that they were now being “properly invigilated” in light of Friday’s attack.Umunna Says Terror Attack Shouldn’t Be Politicized (9:32 a.m.)Liberal Democrat Foreign Affairs spokesman Chuka Umunna criticized the two main parties for turning the terrorist attack into a “political football,” saying instead the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats should all accept at least some blame for creating the current justice system because they have all been in government over the last two decades.Umunna, who quit Labour to join the Lib Dems this year, said the focus should be “on properly funding the parole board and the probation service.”Raab Says He Takes Nothing for Granted (9:25 a.m.)Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who may be facing a tight race to maintain his seat in Parliament, said he’s taking nothing for granted before the Dec. 12 vote.Speaking on Sky’s “Sophy Ridge on Sunday,” Raab said the closeness of the polls in his constituency shows the risk of a hung Parliament, and that voting Conservative was the only way to avoid such an outcome.Former Adviser Says Ministers Ignored Warnings (8:50 a.m.)A prison expert said he warned in 2016 that the parole system couldn’t cope with terrorists, but the government ignored his findings.Writing in the Sunday Times, Ian Acheson, who was hired to advise ministers on the dangers of Islamic extremists in prisons, said he sent then-Justice Secretary Michael Gove a list of 69 recommendations, of which 68 were accepted.

Johnson’s opponent, Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, said he didn’t agree that convicted terrorists always should serve out their full prison terms. He also accused governments of worsening the threat of such attacks and said the “war on terror has manifestly failed.”Must Read: The Tories Secretly Fear Trump Could Wreck Johnson’s ElectionFor more on the election visit ELEC.Key Developments:Johnson pledges Conservative government will make sure convicted terrorists serve their full prison sentencesJohnson plans a review of Britain’s security, defense and foreign policyLabour narrows Tory lead in four of five new opinion pollsSecurity Minister Says Hung Parliament Disrupted Tory Terror Policy (11:19 a.m.)Security minister Brandon Lewis said the government would have already started the process of stopping the early release of convicted terrorists if it wasn’t for the U.K.’s hung parliament.Speaking on BBC Radio’s “Pienaar’s Politics,” Lewis said “we’d already started making steps in that direction” but that “one of the problems with parliament being utterly frozen over Brexit” is that this kind of legislation is unable to pass.The Conservative party won a majority in parliament in 2015, before losing it in 2017 and ruling in a minority government with support from the DUP. A number of resignations and expulsions over Brexit in 2019 further hampered the party’s ability to pass its legislation further.Johnson Refuses to Take Blame for Previous Tory Policies (9:55 a.m.)Prime Minister Boris Johnson sought to distance himself from decisions made by previous Conservative governments as he appeared on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.When pushed on the record of the Tories on law and order and spending since 2010, Johnson repeatedly said he’s only been prime minister since the summer, and that previous governments had to implement “prudent” management of public finances.Johnson also said a government under him would invest more in the criminal justice system. He said about 74 convicted terrorists have been released early, and that they were now being “properly invigilated” in light of Friday’s attack.Umunna Says Terror Attack Shouldn’t Be Politicized (9:32 a.m.)Liberal Democrat Foreign Affairs spokesman Chuka Umunna criticized the two main parties for turning the terrorist attack into a “political football,” saying instead the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats should all accept at least some blame for creating the current justice system because they have all been in government over the last two decades.Umunna, who quit Labour to join the Lib Dems this year, said the focus should be “on properly funding the parole board and the probation service.”Raab Says He Takes Nothing for Granted (9:25 a.m.)Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who may be facing a tight race to maintain his seat in Parliament, said he’s taking nothing for granted before the Dec. 12 vote.Speaking on Sky’s “Sophy Ridge on Sunday,” Raab said the closeness of the polls in his constituency shows the risk of a hung Parliament, and that voting Conservative was the only way to avoid such an outcome.Former Adviser Says Ministers Ignored Warnings (8:50 a.m.)A prison expert said he warned in 2016 that the parole system couldn’t cope with terrorists, but the government ignored his findings.Writing in the Sunday Times, Ian Acheson, who was hired to advise ministers on the dangers of Islamic extremists in prisons, said he sent then-Justice Secretary Michael Gove a list of 69 recommendations, of which 68 were accepted. However, when the government’s report was published, under a new minister Liz Truss, it was weakened so only a fraction of the recommendations remained, including none of those about the probation service.Corbyn Declines to Say How He’d Vote in 2nd Referendum (8:40 a.m.)In the Sky interview, Corbyn avoided saying how he would vote in the second Brexit referendum that he’s promised if Labour wins the election.Corbyn also said the party apologized and regretted any antisemitism anyone’s suffered and that he wished “our party had acted on it more rapidly.” Earlier in the week, Corbyn had repeatedly declined to apologize to Jewish people for the behavior of some in his party.Corbyn Won’t Rule Out Early Release for Terrorists (8:30 a.m)Corbyn said convicted terrorists should not necessarily serve out their full prison terms and pledged to increase spending on the prison service.

So why are so many people in the American military community today worried about the Army’s ability to deter conflicts with likely adversaries or prevail against those adversaries in future wars?The short answer is that warfare, always a mysterious amalgam of art, science, and guts, has become an increasingly complicated and unpredictable enterprise. America’s leading potential adversaries, China and Russia, have shown no small measure of imagination and dexterity in identifying the U.S. armed forces’ vulnerabilities, and exploiting them through the development of subtle yet aggressive geopolitical strategies, and increasingly lethal armed forces.Both “near peer competitors” may well be ahead of the U.S. military in applying newly emerging technologies—artificial intelligence, machine learning, autonomous systems, hypersonic weapons, and nanotechnology—to the ancient military problems of constricting an adversary’s maneuver, neutralizing its offensive weapons, and disrupting its command and control.These cutting-edge technologies, writes Christian Brose, Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, “will enable new battle networks of sensors and shooters to rapidly accelerate the process of detecting, targeting, and striking threats, what the military calls the ‘kill chain.’”Mattis: ‘No Enemy’ Has Done More Harm to Military Readiness Than CongressHow is it that “the most lethal land force in world history” finds itself in this unenviable position? While the Army exhausted itself fighting two frustrating and inconclusive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq over the last 19 years, both Russia and China embarked on grand strategies of regional hegemony designed to undermine the rules-based international order that emerged after World War II under American leadership. Both of these rising powers have developed myriad ways to sew discord and dissent in America’s network of alliances and to expand their spheres of influence.Beijing presents its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as the best path for underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa to gain access to modern infrastructure, capital, and prosperity. In practice, it’s plain that under the guise of building ports, roads, and communications infrastructure around the globe, China is engaged in predatory lending practices meant to gain political leverage and privileged access to foreign assets.In the South China Sea, Beijing has militarized seven hotly disputed islets, and is attempting to pinch the U.S. forces out of this strategically sensitive area entirely, even though international courts have declared China’s claims to these waters to be without foundation.Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin has run rings around the Obama and Trump administrations in the chess game of international politics. He successfully annexed the Crimea in 2014 from Ukraine, and interfered in the presidential election of 2016 via “active measures,” i.e., information warfare aimed at creating confusion and conflict in the American body politic. Moscow also successfully intervened on behalf of the brutal Assad regime in Syria, and Russia is now a major player in the Middle East.As demonstrated in the Ukraine, the Russians are the master practitioners of “hybrid warfare,” in which conventional military operations—and the threat of such operations—are closely integrated with propaganda, proxy campaigns, cyber warfare, coercive diplomacy, and economic threats.Both Russia and China have revitalized creaky and obsolete military establishments into first-class warfighting organizations. The consensus among Western military analysts is that in their respective spheres of influence, both countries have sufficiently sophisticated “anti-access area denial” (A2AD) capabilities to inflict severe punishment on American forces attempting to penetrate those spheres in order to challenge aggression or come to the aid of an ally. According to Army General Mark Milley, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both Russia and China are “deploying capabilities to fight the United States through multiple levels of standoff in all domains—space, cyber, air, sea, and land. The military problem we face is defeating multiple levels of standoff… in order to maintain the coherence of our operations.”Gen. Milley and the rest of the Army’s top brass are well aware that their service is currently a rusty instrument for carrying out high intensity operations warfare against either potential adversary. The Army Strategy, an 11-page, single-spaced document published in October 2018, provides a rough blueprint for the service’s plan to transform itself from a counterinsurgency-oriented organization into the leading practitioner of high intensity war by 2028.It won’t be easy. The Army Strategy calls for truly sweeping, even revolutionary, changes in doctrine, training, and organization of forces.For the first time since the Cold War, the Army has to reconfigure itself to be able to fight and win in a contested environment, where it will not have undisputed control over the air and sea. At the same time, it must prepare to engage potential adversaries more or less continuously in “gray zone conflict.” General Joseph Votel, the recently retired head of Special Operations Command, succinctly defines this concept as “conflicts characterized by intense political, economic, informational, and military competition more fervent in nature than normal diplomacy, yet short of conventional war.”The Army Strategy describes four lines of effort to reach the service’s chief objective by 2028, in this order of priority: Readiness, modernization, department reform, and building alliances and partnerships. The last two lines are more or less pro forma in every American military strategy document I’ve read over the last 30 years: reduce waste and inefficiency, and work with allies to insure military interoperability. The first two lines are worth a close look, for they illuminate the broad contours of the service’s quest to regain its pre-eminence in great power conflict. The quest to enhance readiness begins with plans to increase the size of the regular army to over half a million men from its current level of 476,000. In a departure from recent practice, all units earmarked for contingency operations and overseas deployments will be fully manned and given state of the art equipment before deploying. In order to increase the size of the service, the quality and quantity of recruiters and instructors will be increased.The focus of Army unit training will shift from counterinsurgency operations to high intensity fighting, where the adversary is assumed to have cutting edge A2AD, offensive weapons, and cyber systems.Deployments of Army units around the world will be less predictable and more rapid that they’ve been to date, as the Army and the other armed services begin to put the “Dynamic Force Deployment” concept to work. This concept is closely associated with former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. It’s also classified, and few details have been released for public consumption. But the core idea, as Mattis explained in 2018, is for the U.S. military to “stop telegraphing its punches.” Combat forces and their support units will be moving in and out of potential flashpoint areas more frequently and at unpredictable intervals in order to proactively shape the strategic environment.Improving readiness also involves important upgrades in the Army’s defensive missile systems to counter China and Russia’s formidable A2AD systems. A new lower-tier air and missile defense sensor project will enhance the ability of Patriot missiles to identify and track targets at long range by 2022. Beginning in 2021, Stryker light armored vehicles will be equipped with a new air defense system to protect mechanized battalions and brigades as they maneuver in harm’s way.Missile system upgrades, coupled with an entirely new generation of combat vehicles, both manned and unmanned, will allow the Army of the future to penetrate adversary defenses with an acceptable degree of loss.Ensuring readiness to fight is the top priority of the Army until 2022. After that date, the service plans to turn close attention to implementing entirely new operational concepts and “technologically mature” systems that are currently in the research and development phase.The overarching goal is to be able to conduct sustained “multi-domain operations” against either potential adversary, and win, by 2028. In the modernization phase, the Army plans to introduce a host of new long-range precision weapons, including hypersonic missiles that travel at more than five times the speed of sound. An entirely new generation of combat vehicles and vertical lift aircraft, i.e., new helicopters and aircraft with capabilities similar to those of the V-22 Osprey, both manned and unmanned, are currently in the works.The new Army Network will be an integrated system of hardware, software, and infrastructure capable of withstanding formidable cyber assaults.The leading war-fighting concept at the foundation of the Army’s modernization effort, though, is clearly “multi-domain operations (MDO).” The first thing to be said about the concept is that it’s very much inchoate. Discussions with several active-duty Army officers suggest even those “in the know” about this classified concept have only a hazy idea of how such operations will work in the field, for the simple reason that many of the systems such operations hope to integrate are still in the early stages of development.The Army has only one experimental MDO unit on active duty. It is deployed in the Indo-Pacific Command and built around a conventional rocket and missile brigade. The brigade contains a unique battalion devoted to intelligence, information, cyber, electronic warfare and space operations (I2CEWS). According to Sydney J. Freedberg Jr., an editor at Breaking Defense, the I2CEWS battalion “appears to not only pull together data from outside sources—satellites, drones, spy planes—to inform friendly forces of threats and targets, it also wages war in cyberspace and across the electronic spectrum, hacking and jamming the sensors and networks that tell the enemy where to shoot.”The commander of Army forces in the Indo-Pacific, Gen. Robert Brown, recently told reporters that his experimental brigade has performed brilliantly “in at least ten war games” against what are presumably Chinese and Russian forces. Before the advent of the new unit, American forces repeatedly failed to penetrate either rivals’ anti-access area denial systems with acceptable casualties in war games. Another experimental brigade is expected to enter service in Europe soon.The U.S. Army has a long and unenviable history of being ill-prepared to fight the next war. The French and British had to train U.S. Army units before they were deployed in World War I. The Army entered World War II as the 17th largest army in the world, with underpowered tanks, airplanes, and ancient rifles. The Army that went to Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan had trained long and hard to engage in conventional operations against nation states, but was ill-prepared, psychologically or organizationally, for counter-insurgency war. The Army’s ability to adapt to new developments has long been hampered by infighting and excessive conservatism in the upper reaches of the service’s hierarchy.To remedy this problem, in July 2018 the Army created the Futures Command (AFC). Its purpose is to unify the service-wide modernization effort under a single command, and oversee the development of new doctrine, equipment, organization, and training. According to Gen. John Murray, its head, the AFC “will conduct war-fighting and technology experimentation together, producing innovative, field-informed war-fighting concepts and working prototypes of systems that have a low risk of… being rejected by future war fighters. There are no game-changing technologies. There are only game-changing combinations of war-fighting concepts, technologies and organizations.”To say that General Murray has his work cut out for him is a massive understatement. He surely has one of the most difficult and important assignments in modern military history. Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

But now they have become caricatures and cable news fodder—and their reputations are part of the professional carnage that comes to almost everyone who is part of the Donald Trump story. They are known to the American public primarily for the things they have said, for one reason or the other, about Trump—and even more to the point, for what he has said about them.Rudy Giuliani, James Comey, Robert Mueller, William Barr, James Kallstrom, and Louis Freeh have all taken divergent paths over the past few years. But in the more than two decades that preceded Trump’s descent down the golden escalator on election night 2016, their résumés overlapped as they worked to find the perpetrators and bring them to justice in such cases as Pan Am 103, a 747 blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland; the devastated Federal Building in Oklahoma City; the Khobar Towers full of American personnel, blown up in Saudi Arabia; the Atlanta Olympics bombing; the devastated American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya; the attack on the USS Cole at anchor in Yemen; then, of course 9/11. And it’s a sad fact that the work they did during their impressive law enforcement careers got lost in the noise created by Trump’s presidency.Most interesting of all, however, is the fact that for most of these men, what they thought of Trump in 2016 had a lot to do with their opinion of the occupants of the White House—Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton—during those years their lives had intersected. Those opinions proved to be enduring and consequential. * * *THE DIRECTOR* * *In September 1993, Federal Judge Louis J. Freeh walked out of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and into FBI Headquarters as its new Director. Both his youth, 43 years of age, and his background as a former FBI agent, made him an inspired choice to lead the Bureau when nominated by the new American President, Bill Clinton. Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Cynthia Johnson/The LIFE Images Collection viaGettyFreeh’s predecessor, William Sessions, had not completed his 10-year term as director before a report alleging ethical improprieties was released by President George H. W. Bush’s Attorney General William Barr (yes, the same William Barr who is today Trump’s Attorney General).Sessions refused to exit his position voluntarily, so it was left to Clinton’s new attorney general, Janet Reno, to fire him. Clinton may wish he had held on to Sessions. The new president and the new FBI Director would soon be at loggerheads. Although there was still a sense of excitement in Washington over the generational shift that the 1992 election represented, the fact was the Clinton administration began as an unmitigated disaster. It seemed undisciplined and chaotic to Freeh, and its early days were consumed with FBI investigations into Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater, Paula Jones and Jennifer Flowers, and even an investigation into China’s attempts to meddle in the 1992 elections. And, most mysteriously, there was the investigation into the shocking suicide of Bill and Hillary’s long-time friend from Arkansas, Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. FBI agents walked around the halls dispirited, talking about their affection for George H.W. Bush and their disdain for the dirty campaign they felt the Clintons had waged against him. While Clinton came off cool (playing sax on The Arsenio Hall Show, for example), “The Wimp Factor” tagline stuck to George H.W. Bush—a man who had flown 50 combat missions during World War II, had been one of the Navy’s youngest aviators and was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross.  Freeh, who had been appointed a federal judge by the senior Bush, had a deep affection for him. He accepted the job as FBI Director even though he believed not only that the wrong man had won the presidency, but was firmly convinced that the winner, Clinton, was dirty. In those years, the FBI’s antipathy towards the Clintons flowed from the top down—and would become ingrained in its organizational culture. For his part, had Clinton wanted an FBI Director who would do his bidding and sweep his scandals under the rug (which the current president seems to believe is part of the job description), he knew damn well it wouldn’t be Freeh. Yet, he courted Freeh. Freeh, considered tough and clean as a hound’s tooth, would give the new Clinton Administration a patina of ethical validity it desperately needed. But Freeh’s FBI was immediately immersed in investigating Clinton’s skeletons. Freeh gave back his White House pass that had allowed him unlimited, unrecorded, access to the White House believing it would pose a conflict of interest while the Clintons were under investigation. Clinton, now realizing Freeh would be breathing down his neck, was not happy with this slap in the face. But during his entire administration, and with the endless ethical clouds that hung over him, Clinton did not dare fire Freeh.Freeh and Clinton would not speak for four years, until the bombing of the USS Cole.* * *THE HILL* * *Freeh was an instant darling with Members of Congress, and was accorded great deference and latitude. He would need it. The FBI Freeh walked into had a plethora of problems and investigations of its own to contend with. His earnest demeanor served him well—and he was complemented by his equally earnest Congressional liaison chief, John Collingwood, who was spectacularly effective at putting out the FBI’s fires. Without a drop of arrogance and possessing a deep belief in the mission of the Bureau, Collingwood was also a master at turning every FBI screw-up into an opportunity—for more resources or more law enforcement authorities. He was perhaps the greatest asset the Bureau had when facing its many challenges with Congress. When I worked in his office, I learned from Collingwood a simple formula for dealing with the Hill that most federal agencies refused to learn: Congress can be your best friend if you don’t treat its members and staff like the enemy. Give them (most of) what they ask for, be personable and on a first-name basis with staffers, and give them a heads-up to important stories before they hit the media—even if its means calling them at home at 2 a.m. (which we often did). If trust is built, Congressional staffers will, in turn, give you a heads up to potential problematic or embarrassing issues that could otherwise blindside the Director at an oversight hearing. (The first rule of any good staff work, anywhere: never, ever allow your boss to be surprised by bad news.)Collingwood could wrap his arm around the shoulder of Senator Robert Byrd (the most powerful man in Congress at the time), and Byrd would feel the entire goodwill of the FBI in that gesture—especially after Byrd made it possible for the FBI to move its badly outdated Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) to Clarksburg, West Virginia, Byrd’s home state. The CJIS is the largest division of the FBI responsible for, among other things, its automated fingerprint identification lab and national instant criminal background check system. Byrd was known as “the king of pork” for his ability to shovel millions of dollars to West Virginia. The FBI was smart enough to seize on the opportunity Byrd was offering, thus giving him a stake in the sustainability of the FBI, as well as much needed jobs for West Virginians.And the FBI’s sustainability was not a given. Freeh took charge of an FBI still reeling from its role in the carnage that occurred at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and Waco, Texas. Both locations had been the site of standoffs between citizens and federal agents, and Waco and Ruby Ridge had become rallying cries for anti-government militias. The overly aggressive actions of federal agents had left 83 Americans dead. The country’s faith in federal law enforcement was at an all-time low. Armed, anti-government militia groups were sprouting up across the nation. At the same time, far removed from Ruby Ridge and Waco, in lower Manhattan an even more insidious threat was about to make itself known. On Feb. 26, 1993, a rental truck carrying 1,400 pounds of ammonium nitrate exploded under the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Six people were killed in an attack right in the heart of America’s financial center.The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan had energized the jihadist movement around the world. After the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan, mujahideen veterans and fellow-travelers seemed to replace their anti-Soviet fervor with an extreme anti-American ideology. Many began congregating in Islamic centers and mosques across the U.S., including New York and New Jersey. Although American military assistance had helped turn the tide for the mujahideen in their war against the Soviets, they now turned their sights toward the U.S. This was known as “blowback.” But blowback would not be coming just from Afghanistan’s jihadists. It was also developing in America’s heartland.* * *OKLAHOMA CITY* * *The security guard sitting outside the offices of the House Intelligence Committee stopped me and pointed to the television on his desk. On the screen was a horrific scene coming out of Oklahoma City. A building was sheared in half. Under tons of rubble lay an unknown number of bodies. A moon-like crater was obvious in the street where a Ryder rental truck had detonated 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate—a much bigger and more powerful bomb than the one used in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.  Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Ralf-Finn Hestoft/CORBIS viaGettyWhen Timothy McVeigh was apprehended, the motive for the carnage became clear. The date of the slaughter was April 19, 1995, exactly two years after the federal standoff at David Koresh’s compound in Waco, Texas. This was McVeigh’s revenge—blowing up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 people, including 19 children.The scale of the Oklahoma City attack, the very audacity of it, the very cruelty of it, committed by an American against other Americans, seemed like evil incarnate. Here was an “all-American white boy,” as people said, brutally killing fellow innocent Americans and children right in America’s heartland because of his hatred for federal agencies. If this level of anger existed out there in the country, how and where else might it express itself? Federal law enforcement and the media became obsessed and slightly hysterical over the idea of anti-government militias, even though McVeigh had no formal ties to any of them. Ultimately, however, McVeigh’s actions had an effect opposite to the one he intended. Instead of adding fuel to the anti-government movement, militia members resented the fact that the Feds would now be breathing down their necks. And they certainly were disgusted by the killing of so many innocent children. Some militia members began cooperating with the Feds, alerting them to possible violent extremists in their midsts. The FBI created a Domestic Terrorism Planning Section which found itself handling mostly threats against abortion clinics and crimes committed by radical animal rights groups, like the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). Without reasonable cause, there was little the FBI could do to surveil American citizens traipsing through the woods with legally owned firearms playing weekend warrior. They couldn’t be arrested simply for their views. But after Oklahoma City, the FBI drafted a wish list of expanded authorities to monitor potential terrorists domestically. A coalition of left and right civil libertarians on the Hill thwarted attempts to pass these measures. (Some of the expanded authorities gained new life after 9/11 when they became part of The Patriot Act.)Trump Is First to Use PATRIOT Act to Detain a Man Forever* * *THE SAUDI MIRROR* * *One again the terror spotlight was about to shift. On June 26, 1996, just weeks after the FBI had successfully concluded an 81-day standoff with the anti-government Freeman group in Montana, a truck bomb exploded in a housing complex in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 Air Force personnel who were there to enforce the no-fly zone imposed on the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Hezbollah in the Hijaz (or “Saudi Hezbollah”) took credit for the attack. Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/GettyThe Saudis knew more than they let on to the FBI about this group, but getting information from the Saudis involved a very delicate diplomatic dance—something FBI agents abhor. The deference paid to the Saudis after Khobar would never be accorded to another country within whose borders American servicemen had been killed. Less than a year before the Khobar bombing, another bomb had exploded in Riyadh, killing five U.S. Defense Department contractors. But before the FBI could interrogate the suspects, the Saudis extracted confessions from them and had them beheaded. Now 19 American airmen had been killed in Saudi Arabia, and the United States was once again saying “pretty please” to Saudi royals to get them to share information. It’s hard to determine whether it was Freeh’s strained relationship with the Clinton administration, or the Clinton administration’s hope for a rapprochement with Iran that led to other roadblocks in the Khobar investigation. Iran was clearly behind Saudi Hezbollah, but it was the Saudis, and the Saudis alone, who held the key to the investigation. With the information they possessed on the attack the year before, Khobar might have been prevented.  To shake information loose from the Saudis, and with less than enthusiastic support from the Clinton Administration, Freeh turned again to his friend, former President George H.W. Bush, who had liberated Kuwait from Saddam’s occupation and guaranteed the security of Saudi Arabia four years earlier. Freeh also weighed in with his own pal, the flamboyant Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar bin Sultan.  As Lawrence Wright reported in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, The Looming Tower, John O’Neill, the chief of the FBI’s Counterterrorism Section, had angered Freeh (who valued his relationship with Bush, Prince Bandar, and his ability to gain access to Saudi Arabia without help from the Clinton White House) by telling him on a flight home from the Kingdom, “Boss, they’re blowing smoke up your ass.” The FBI did finally get access of sorts to the Khobar detainees held by the Saudis—but only by watching behind a two-way mirror as members of the Mabahith, the Saudi secret police, asked the questions. * * *PRECEDENTS* * *To understand how the Bureau developed its response to terrorist attacks you’d have to go back to the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people. Pan Am 103 was the first major terrorist attack against American civilians. A Hezbollah bombing of the US Marine Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon three years earlier had killed 220 Marines and 21 civilians. But Pan Am 103 was a watershed: 190 passengers had been American citizens on their way home for the Christmas holidays; 43 were British, and at least 19 other nationalities were represented among the lost. Among those killed were 35 students from Syracuse University returning to the U.S. after a semester studying in London. The U.N. Commissioner for Namibia, the CEO for Volkswagen America, the CIA’s Beirut Deputy Station Chief and a group of other U.S. Intelligence specialists were on that flight, raising suspicion that it might have been specially targeted. Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Bryn Colton/GettyLegislation was passed giving the FBI extraterritorial jurisdiction over investigations wherever Americans were killed, and the Pan Am 103 investigation would be handled by the Justice Department’s Criminal Division—headed by one Robert S. Mueller—a recent Bush 41 appointee. Mueller had been overseeing the prosecution of Manuel Noriega and mob boss John Gotti, but Pan Am 103 had the greatest emotional impact on him. As recently as 2018, Mueller met once again with family members of that ill-fated flight, including the now-adult children of victims, telling them, “There are those who say that time heals all wounds. But you know that not to be true. At its best, time may dull the deepest wounds; it cannot make them disappear.”  Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Ron Sachs/Consolidated News Pictures/GettyOn Nov. 19, 1991, Acting Attorney General William Barr (yes, the same William Barr who is attorney general today), announced the indictments of two Libyan intelligence operatives for placing the bomb that destroyed Pan Am 103. A trial would not begin until 2000. In 2003, Libya would pay $2.7 billion in compensation to the families of the victims. The man found guilty, Abdelbasit Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, would ultimately die at home in Tripoli in 2017.But in 1988, never having dealt with a terrorist attack on the scale of Pan Am 103, the Bureau received very poor marks for its outreach to the grieving families. So when the Khobar Towers bombings occurred, Freeh would go out of his way to promise justice to the victims’ families—a justice that would, however, have to be finessed to suit Saudi sensibilities.In his 2005 memoir, My FBI, Freeh credits the ultimately successful indictments of the Khobar Tower suspects to his hand-picked choice as prosecutor, James B. Comey. (Yes, that James Comey.) “I will always be grateful for his leadership and pursuit of justice,” Freeh wrote of Comey, who was responsible for a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia returning a 46-count indictment against 14 defendants charged with the bombing of the Khobar Towers.But the Bureau barely had time to catch its breath. Just three weeks after the Khobar Towers attack, the genuine, overwhelming desire by the FBI to convince grieving families they would receive justice would be tested in unimaginable ways. On July 17, 1996, TWA 800 exploded over the Atlantic shortly after taking off from JFK airport, killing 240 people.END OF PART ONETOMORROW: CONSPIRACIES AND DISASTERSRead more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

And it’s a sad fact that the work they did during their impressive law enforcement careers got lost in the noise created by Trump’s presidency.Most interesting of all, however, is the fact that for most of these men, what they thought of Trump in 2016 had a lot to do with their opinion of the occupants of the White House—Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton—during those years their lives had intersected. Those opinions proved to be enduring and consequential. * * *THE DIRECTOR* * *In September 1993, Federal Judge Louis J. Freeh walked out of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and into FBI Headquarters as its new Director. Both his youth, 43 years of age, and his background as a former FBI agent, made him an inspired choice to lead the Bureau when nominated by the new American President, Bill Clinton. Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Cynthia Johnson/The LIFE Images Collection viaGettyFreeh’s predecessor, William Sessions, had not completed his 10-year term as director before a report alleging ethical improprieties was released by President George H. W. Bush’s Attorney General William Barr (yes, the same William Barr who is today Trump’s Attorney General).Sessions refused to exit his position voluntarily, so it was left to Clinton’s new attorney general, Janet Reno, to fire him. Clinton may wish he had held on to Sessions. The new president and the new FBI Director would soon be at loggerheads. Although there was still a sense of excitement in Washington over the generational shift that the 1992 election represented, the fact was the Clinton administration began as an unmitigated disaster. It seemed undisciplined and chaotic to Freeh, and its early days were consumed with FBI investigations into Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater, Paula Jones and Jennifer Flowers, and even an investigation into China’s attempts to meddle in the 1992 elections. And, most mysteriously, there was the investigation into the shocking suicide of Bill and Hillary’s long-time friend from Arkansas, Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. FBI agents walked around the halls dispirited, talking about their affection for George H.W. Bush and their disdain for the dirty campaign they felt the Clintons had waged against him. While Clinton came off cool (playing sax on The Arsenio Hall Show, for example), “The Wimp Factor” tagline stuck to George H.W. Bush—a man who had flown 50 combat missions during World War II, had been one of the Navy’s youngest aviators and was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross.  Freeh, who had been appointed a federal judge by the senior Bush, had a deep affection for him. He accepted the job as FBI Director even though he believed not only that the wrong man had won the presidency, but was firmly convinced that the winner, Clinton, was dirty. In those years, the FBI’s antipathy towards the Clintons flowed from the top down—and would become ingrained in its organizational culture. For his part, had Clinton wanted an FBI Director who would do his bidding and sweep his scandals under the rug (which the current president seems to believe is part of the job description), he knew damn well it wouldn’t be Freeh. Yet, he courted Freeh. Freeh, considered tough and clean as a hound’s tooth, would give the new Clinton Administration a patina of ethical validity it desperately needed. But Freeh’s FBI was immediately immersed in investigating Clinton’s skeletons. Freeh gave back his White House pass that had allowed him unlimited, unrecorded, access to the White House believing it would pose a conflict of interest while the Clintons were under investigation. Clinton, now realizing Freeh would be breathing down his neck, was not happy with this slap in the face. But during his entire administration, and with the endless ethical clouds that hung over him, Clinton did not dare fire Freeh.Freeh and Clinton would not speak for four years, until the bombing of the USS Cole.* * *THE HILL* * *Freeh was an instant darling with Members of Congress, and was accorded great deference and latitude. He would need it. The FBI Freeh walked into had a plethora of problems and investigations of its own to contend with. His earnest demeanor served him well—and he was complemented by his equally earnest Congressional liaison chief, John Collingwood, who was spectacularly effective at putting out the FBI’s fires. Without a drop of arrogance and possessing a deep belief in the mission of the Bureau, Collingwood was also a master at turning every FBI screw-up into an opportunity—for more resources or more law enforcement authorities. He was perhaps the greatest asset the Bureau had when facing its many challenges with Congress. When I worked in his office, I learned from Collingwood a simple formula for dealing with the Hill that most federal agencies refused to learn: Congress can be your best friend if you don’t treat its members and staff like the enemy. Give them (most of) what they ask for, be personable and on a first-name basis with staffers, and give them a heads-up to important stories before they hit the media—even if its means calling them at home at 2 a.m. (which we often did). If trust is built, Congressional staffers will, in turn, give you a heads up to potential problematic or embarrassing issues that could otherwise blindside the Director at an oversight hearing. (The first rule of any good staff work, anywhere: never, ever allow your boss to be surprised by bad news.)Collingwood could wrap his arm around the shoulder of Senator Robert Byrd (the most powerful man in Congress at the time), and Byrd would feel the entire goodwill of the FBI in that gesture—especially after Byrd made it possible for the FBI to move its badly outdated Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) to Clarksburg, West Virginia, Byrd’s home state. The CJIS is the largest division of the FBI responsible for, among other things, its automated fingerprint identification lab and national instant criminal background check system. Byrd was known as “the king of pork” for his ability to shovel millions of dollars to West Virginia. The FBI was smart enough to seize on the opportunity Byrd was offering, thus giving him a stake in the sustainability of the FBI, as well as much needed jobs for West Virginians.And the FBI’s sustainability was not a given. Freeh took charge of an FBI still reeling from its role in the carnage that occurred at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and Waco, Texas. Both locations had been the site of standoffs between citizens and federal agents, and Waco and Ruby Ridge had become rallying cries for anti-government militias. The overly aggressive actions of federal agents had left 83 Americans dead. The country’s faith in federal law enforcement was at an all-time low. Armed, anti-government militia groups were sprouting up across the nation. At the same time, far removed from Ruby Ridge and Waco, in lower Manhattan an even more insidious threat was about to make itself known. On Feb. 26, 1993, a rental truck carrying 1,400 pounds of ammonium nitrate exploded under the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Six people were killed in an attack right in the heart of America’s financial center.The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan had energized the jihadist movement around the world. After the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan, mujahideen veterans and fellow-travelers seemed to replace their anti-Soviet fervor with an extreme anti-American ideology. Many began congregating in Islamic centers and mosques across the U.S., including New York and New Jersey. Although American military assistance had helped turn the tide for the mujahideen in their war against the Soviets, they now turned their sights toward the U.S. This was known as “blowback.” But blowback would not be coming just from Afghanistan’s jihadists. It was also developing in America’s heartland.* * *OKLAHOMA CITY* * *The security guard sitting outside the offices of the House Intelligence Committee stopped me and pointed to the television on his desk. On the screen was a horrific scene coming out of Oklahoma City. A building was sheared in half. Under tons of rubble lay an unknown number of bodies. A moon-like crater was obvious in the street where a Ryder rental truck had detonated 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate—a much bigger and more powerful bomb than the one used in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.  Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Ralf-Finn Hestoft/CORBIS viaGettyWhen Timothy McVeigh was apprehended, the motive for the carnage became clear. The date of the slaughter was April 19, 1995, exactly two years after the federal standoff at David Koresh’s compound in Waco, Texas. This was McVeigh’s revenge—blowing up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 people, including 19 children.The scale of the Oklahoma City attack, the very audacity of it, the very cruelty of it, committed by an American against other Americans, seemed like evil incarnate. Here was an “all-American white boy,” as people said, brutally killing fellow innocent Americans and children right in America’s heartland because of his hatred for federal agencies. If this level of anger existed out there in the country, how and where else might it express itself? Federal law enforcement and the media became obsessed and slightly hysterical over the idea of anti-government militias, even though McVeigh had no formal ties to any of them. Ultimately, however, McVeigh’s actions had an effect opposite to the one he intended. Instead of adding fuel to the anti-government movement, militia members resented the fact that the Feds would now be breathing down their necks. And they certainly were disgusted by the killing of so many innocent children. Some militia members began cooperating with the Feds, alerting them to possible violent extremists in their midsts. The FBI created a Domestic Terrorism Planning Section which found itself handling mostly threats against abortion clinics and crimes committed by radical animal rights groups, like the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). Without reasonable cause, there was little the FBI could do to surveil American citizens traipsing through the woods with legally owned firearms playing weekend warrior. They couldn’t be arrested simply for their views. But after Oklahoma City, the FBI drafted a wish list of expanded authorities to monitor potential terrorists domestically. A coalition of left and right civil libertarians on the Hill thwarted attempts to pass these measures. (Some of the expanded authorities gained new life after 9/11 when they became part of The Patriot Act.)Trump Is First to Use PATRIOT Act to Detain a Man Forever* * *THE SAUDI MIRROR* * *One again the terror spotlight was about to shift. On June 26, 1996, just weeks after the FBI had successfully concluded an 81-day standoff with the anti-government Freeman group in Montana, a truck bomb exploded in a housing complex in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 Air Force personnel who were there to enforce the no-fly zone imposed on the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Hezbollah in the Hijaz (or “Saudi Hezbollah”) took credit for the attack. Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/GettyThe Saudis knew more than they let on to the FBI about this group, but getting information from the Saudis involved a very delicate diplomatic dance—something FBI agents abhor. The deference paid to the Saudis after Khobar would never be accorded to another country within whose borders American servicemen had been killed. Less than a year before the Khobar bombing, another bomb had exploded in Riyadh, killing five U.S. Defense Department contractors. But before the FBI could interrogate the suspects, the Saudis extracted confessions from them and had them beheaded. Now 19 American airmen had been killed in Saudi Arabia, and the United States was once again saying “pretty please” to Saudi royals to get them to share information. It’s hard to determine whether it was Freeh’s strained relationship with the Clinton administration, or the Clinton administration’s hope for a rapprochement with Iran that led to other roadblocks in the Khobar investigation. Iran was clearly behind Saudi Hezbollah, but it was the Saudis, and the Saudis alone, who held the key to the investigation. With the information they possessed on the attack the year before, Khobar might have been prevented.  To shake information loose from the Saudis, and with less than enthusiastic support from the Clinton Administration, Freeh turned again to his friend, former President George H.W. Bush, who had liberated Kuwait from Saddam’s occupation and guaranteed the security of Saudi Arabia four years earlier. Freeh also weighed in with his own pal, the flamboyant Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar bin Sultan.  As Lawrence Wright reported in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, The Looming Tower, John O’Neill, the chief of the FBI’s Counterterrorism Section, had angered Freeh (who valued his relationship with Bush, Prince Bandar, and his ability to gain access to Saudi Arabia without help from the Clinton White House) by telling him on a flight home from the Kingdom, “Boss, they’re blowing smoke up your ass.” The FBI did finally get access of sorts to the Khobar detainees held by the Saudis—but only by watching behind a two-way mirror as members of the Mabahith, the Saudi secret police, asked the questions. * * *PRECEDENTS* * *To understand how the Bureau developed its response to terrorist attacks you’d have to go back to the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people. Pan Am 103 was the first major terrorist attack against American civilians. A Hezbollah bombing of the US Marine Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon three years earlier had killed 220 Marines and 21 civilians. But Pan Am 103 was a watershed: 190 passengers had been American citizens on their way home for the Christmas holidays; 43 were British, and at least 19 other nationalities were represented among the lost. Among those killed were 35 students from Syracuse University returning to the U.S. after a semester studying in London. The U.N. Commissioner for Namibia, the CEO for Volkswagen America, the CIA’s Beirut Deputy Station Chief and a group of other U.S. Intelligence specialists were on that flight, raising suspicion that it might have been specially targeted. Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Bryn Colton/GettyLegislation was passed giving the FBI extraterritorial jurisdiction over investigations wherever Americans were killed, and the Pan Am 103 investigation would be handled by the Justice Department’s Criminal Division—headed by one Robert S. Mueller—a recent Bush 41 appointee. Mueller had been overseeing the prosecution of Manuel Noriega and mob boss John Gotti, but Pan Am 103 had the greatest emotional impact on him. As recently as 2018, Mueller met once again with family members of that ill-fated flight, including the now-adult children of victims, telling them, “There are those who say that time heals all wounds. But you know that not to be true. At its best, time may dull the deepest wounds; it cannot make them disappear.”  Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Ron Sachs/Consolidated News Pictures/GettyOn Nov. 19, 1991, Acting Attorney General William Barr (yes, the same William Barr who is attorney general today), announced the indictments of two Libyan intelligence operatives for placing the bomb that destroyed Pan Am 103. A trial would not begin until 2000. In 2003, Libya would pay $2.7 billion in compensation to the families of the victims. The man found guilty, Abdelbasit Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, would ultimately die at home in Tripoli in 2017.But in 1988, never having dealt with a terrorist attack on the scale of Pan Am 103, the Bureau received very poor marks for its outreach to the grieving families. So when the Khobar Towers bombings occurred, Freeh would go out of his way to promise justice to the victims’ families—a justice that would, however, have to be finessed to suit Saudi sensibilities.In his 2005 memoir, My FBI, Freeh credits the ultimately successful indictments of the Khobar Tower suspects to his hand-picked choice as prosecutor, James B. Comey. (Yes, that James Comey.) “I will always be grateful for his leadership and pursuit of justice,” Freeh wrote of Comey, who was responsible for a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia returning a 46-count indictment against 14 defendants charged with the bombing of the Khobar Towers.But the Bureau barely had time to catch its breath. Just three weeks after the Khobar Towers attack, the genuine, overwhelming desire by the FBI to convince grieving families they would receive justice would be tested in unimaginable ways. On July 17, 1996, TWA 800 exploded over the Atlantic shortly after taking off from JFK airport, killing 240 people.END OF PART ONETOMORROW: CONSPIRACIES AND DISASTERSRead more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

He was referring to an interview the French leader gave last month in which he not only criticized Turkey, but described the alliance as brain dead.With three significant member states bringing conflicting agendas to the table at a gathering that takes place in the closing stretch of a charged U.K. election campaign, the event risks fanning concern about NATO’s future, rather than celebrating what alliance officials and leaders routinely call the most successful military grouping in history.Officials from the U..S. and Britain were at pains last week to highlight NATO’s successes, including a renewed sense of purpose since Russia’s 2014 aggression in Ukraine.

In an apparent attempt to contain the debate, Germany has proposed forming an expert group to report on the future political shape of the alliance.Macron drove Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel to make an uncharacteristically spirited defense of the alliance last week. “Even more than during the Cold War, maintaining NATO is today in our own best interest,” she told lawmakers in Berlin. “Europe cannot currently defend itself alone.”Read more: Erdogan May Seek EU Money Even as He Trades Insults With MacronA senior U.S. official said on Friday that Trump would prioritize enlisting NATO to push back against China’s growing influence. The official said Trump would also press allies to increase defense spending and to exclude Chinese companies from the construction of 5G mobile networks, something many have been unwilling to do.Instead of containing China, Macron wants NATO to prioritize the fight against terrorism. Thirteen French soldiers died in Mali last week and a lone terrorist on Friday killed two people in London. A French official said Macron also plans to press for greater “operational” burden-sharing as a way of complementing Trump’s push for Europe to share more of the alliance’s financial burden.Erdogan, meanwhile, is demanding acceptance of Turkish goals in northern Syria, including classifying as a terrorist threat the Kurdish militias that have fought Islamic State alongside other NATO allies. He also rubbed salt into another open wound in Turkey’s ties with Western allies, by unpacking and testing the NATO non-compatible S-400 air defense system he recently bought from Russia.Read more: NATO Foresees More Europe Defense Outlays as It Braces for TrumpAnd that’s all before Trump makes his first tweet of the event.“It will be a great tribute to how much all the NATO allies value the institution if we manage to get through this leaders meeting without President Trump, President Macron or President Erdogan doing something damaging to the alliance,” said Kori Schake, a former National Security Council official in the George W. Bush administration.The shortened time frame for meeting –- formal sessions will take only about four hours -- may limit the potential for damage. Long term NATO watchers also caution against exaggerating the dangers of intra-alliance tensions, which aren’t new to an organization that includes countries with differing geographies and security priorities.Macron’s questioning of the collective defense commitment at NATO’s heart is certainly dangerous, but in many ways he is simply reverting to France’s traditionally semi-detached status. President Charles De Gaulle pulled out of the organization’s military command structure in 1966, and France rejoined only in 2009.Read more: Macron Says NATO Should Shift Its Focus Away From Russia“It’s not a fashionable view, I know,” said Sir Adam Thomson, the U.K.’s envoy to NATO from 2014-2016, but NATO “has been pursuing a new vision since the end of the Cold War and, to some extent, it’s already got a lot of the material.”He cited three new roles since the Cold War: Crisis management in places like Afghanistan, keeping a lid on potential disputes between members in eastern Europe, and building partnerships with dozens of non-member countries.“It is quite distinctive that this alliance, which in the eyes of some is so wicked, finds so many partners to work with it.”As the site of NATO’s first headquarters, London was a natural choice for this week’s anniversary. It was also supposed to make a statement on the global stature of a new post-Brexit Britain.Read more: Johnson Plans Major Review of U.K.’s Defense, Foreign PolicyBrexit, however, has since been delayed. Johnson also called a snap election that will happen just eight days after the leaders fly home. The presence of Trump, a toxic figure among British voters, is a potential political liability for the prime minister.Were Johnson to lose to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, that would give NATO yet another individual to worry about at its next summit, due in 2021.Over his career the socialist firebrand has called NATO “a danger to world peace and a danger to world security,” among other things. He has more recently fallen into line with party policy, which is for the U.K. to stay in the alliance, but he would likely prove another awkward partner.The last time Britain hosted NATO leaders, in 2014, he told an anti-NATO rally that the end of the Cold War “should have been the time for NATO to shut up shop, give up, go home and go away.”&#92;--With assistance from Onur Ant, Geraldine Amiel and Justin Sink.To contact the reporters on this story: Marc Champion in London at mchampion7@bloomberg.net;Jonathan Stearns in Brussels at jstearns2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rosalind Mathieson at rmathieson3@bloomberg.net, Flavia Krause-JacksonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","description":"(Bloomberg) -- What was conceived as a celebration for one of the world’s most important military alliances risks becoming a show of disunity -- and this time it’s not because of anything Donald Trump has said or done.Meeting in London this week, leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have two other presidents to worry about: France’s Emmanuel Macron, who in recent weeks has openly questioned the collective defense clause at NATO’s heart, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has troubled alliance members with his decisions to send troops into Syria and buy a Russian anti-missile system.To make matters worse, Macron and Erdogan are now trading insults in public.In fact, so much has changed since then-Prime Minister Theresa May offered to host the two-day commemoration of NATO’s 70th anniversary that her successor, Boris Johnson could be forgiven for wishing she hadn’t.“I will tell you again at NATO, first check your own brain death,” Erdogan said, addressing Macron in a speech from Istanbul on Friday.

Long term NATO watchers also caution against exaggerating the dangers of intra-alliance tensions, which aren’t new to an organization that includes countries with differing geographies and security priorities.Macron’s questioning of the collective defense commitment at NATO’s heart is certainly dangerous, but in many ways he is simply reverting to France’s traditionally semi-detached status. President Charles De Gaulle pulled out of the organization’s military command structure in 1966, and France rejoined only in 2009.Read more: Macron Says NATO Should Shift Its Focus Away From Russia“It’s not a fashionable view, I know,” said Sir Adam Thomson, the U.K.’s envoy to NATO from 2014-2016, but NATO “has been pursuing a new vision since the end of the Cold War and, to some extent, it’s already got a lot of the material.”He cited three new roles since the Cold War: Crisis management in places like Afghanistan, keeping a lid on potential disputes between members in eastern Europe, and building partnerships with dozens of non-member countries.“It is quite distinctive that this alliance, which in the eyes of some is so wicked, finds so many partners to work with it.”As the site of NATO’s first headquarters, London was a natural choice for this week’s anniversary. It was also supposed to make a statement on the global stature of a new post-Brexit Britain.Read more: Johnson Plans Major Review of U.K.’s Defense, Foreign PolicyBrexit, however, has since been delayed. Johnson also called a snap election that will happen just eight days after the leaders fly home. The presence of Trump, a toxic figure among British voters, is a potential political liability for the prime minister.Were Johnson to lose to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, that would give NATO yet another individual to worry about at its next summit, due in 2021.Over his career the socialist firebrand has called NATO “a danger to world peace and a danger to world security,” among other things. He has more recently fallen into line with party policy, which is for the U.K. to stay in the alliance, but he would likely prove another awkward partner.The last time Britain hosted NATO leaders, in 2014, he told an anti-NATO rally that the end of the Cold War “should have been the time for NATO to shut up shop, give up, go home and go away.”&#92;--With assistance from Onur Ant, Geraldine Amiel and Justin Sink.To contact the reporters on this story: Marc Champion in London at mchampion7@bloomberg.net;Jonathan Stearns in Brussels at jstearns2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rosalind Mathieson at rmathieson3@bloomberg.net, Flavia Krause-JacksonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https://news.yahoo.com/time-trump-just-one-wild-060001702.html","date":"2019-12-01T06:00:01.000Z","id":1218},"1219":{"title":"Iran begins registering candidates for parliamentary polls","summary":"Iran has begun registration of candidates for running in the country’s parliamentary elections set for February 2020, the official IRNA news agency reported on Sunday.

Almost Everything.","summary":"Jane Sweeney/GettySEVASTOPOL, Crimea—The seductive voice of the late French songwriter Serge Gainsbourg played as background. “Je t’aime.. moi non plus.” And waiters in long white aprons drifted among the tables at the La Brasserie café. Looking at the exaggerated 19th century Parisian interior, nobody would have guessed Sevastopol’s tragic past and turbulent present. Several wars and conflicts have left this strategic Black Sea port in ashes, pushing waves of terrified people away from the sandy beaches and green hills of the Crimean peninsula as refugees and exiles. Today, almost five years after Russia took this land from Ukraine, one sees articles in the Western press starting to tout Crimea as a tourist destination, even as sanctions against Russia keep it isolated economically. Some residents say life in this city has come to seem “a parallel universe.”Trump at G7 Blames Everybody but Putin for Crimea AnnexationOur tourist guide, Alexander Kuts, a local expert in Crimean history, suggested we step outside of the café to see the main highlights along the embankment. War museums, memorials and monuments were all around us, a vivid map of strife that killed hundreds of thousands of people since the name of Crimea first became a byword for Great Power confrontation in the 1850s.The city of Sevastopol was founded by Russian Empress Catherine the Great in 1783, the first time Crimea was taken over by Moscow. The French philosopher Voltaire, fascinated by Russia, wrote to Catherine that he saw Russia’s European destiny in the Black Sea region where it would push out Turkey, and he endorsed the “genius” of the empress who took control of Crimea as well as other regions along the Azov and Black Seas coasts. But its very importance made Crimea hard to hold on to. By the mid-1800s Turkey and Europe were pushing back.Alexander, our guide, pointed to a place in the bay where Admiral Pavel Nakhimov and other Russian navy commanders made the decision in September 1854 to scuttle seven of their own ships to block the entrance to the harbor. Only the masts remained above the water. The tactic stopped the British and French fleet approaching the city center, but the troops landed to the north virtually unopposed, then pushed southward in a long and horrifying campaign. After the battle of Inkerman, now a suburb of Sevastopol, British war correspondent William Howard Russell wrote to his wife about friends he had lost, “buried as they lay all bloody on the hillside amid their ferocious enemies, and I could not but exclaim in all bitterness of heart, ‘Cursed is he that delighteth in war.’” Russell wrote that he found it impossible to sleep in his tent that night “owing to the groans of dying Russian prisoners outside. They are as thick on the field as sparrows on a hayrick. They literally die in heaps, and they are buried 30 together in holes in the ground. The air stinks of blood.”In Leo Tolstoy’s “Tales of Sevastopol” he writes about the carnage of the Crimean War that he saw as a young officer in the Russian army. Tolstoy wondered at the extraordinary courage of the common soldiers risking their lives to  defend the city: “the kind of men who are capable of living calmly under a hail of shot and shell … in conditions of constant, toil, vigilance and filth. Men cannot endure such awful conditions for the sake of a Cross or a title, or under threat of punishment: some other, more exalted reason must prompt them. And this reason is a feeling that is rarely displayed, shyly hidden by the Russian, but nonetheless entrenched deep within each—love for the mother country.”The siege of Sevastopol (or Sebastopol, as the British and French spelled it) went on for almost a year before, finally, it fell. And yet, when the Ottoman Empire, the British Empire, the French Empire, the Austrian Empire, Sardinia (the most powerful kingdom of Italy), and Prussia signed a peace agreement with the Russian Empire in Paris the following spring, Sevastopol was just another bargaining chip for the monarchs of Europe to trade on the map, and it went back to the tsar.On December 9 this year, there will be an echo of that history when world leaders sit down for one more peace agreement in Paris. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to try to decide the future of the war in Eastern Ukraine, or Donbas, that began in the spring of 2014 after pro-Russian President Victor Yanukovych was toppled and Russia unilaterally took Crimea away from Ukraine. According to Russia, taking Crimea was not an aggressive act of annexation, it was “reunification” with the motherland, which is one reason history weighs so heavily here, where the air once stank of Russian blood.* * *SHIFTING SOVEREIGNTY* * *In Soviet times, in 1954, Crimea was assigned to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when Ukraine gained its independence in 1991, it kept the peninsula. Under an agreement brokered in part by the United States, Kyiv agreed to give up the many nuclear weapons left in its possession in exchange for guarantees that Russia would “respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.”  But that was in 1994. In 2014, Putin simply ignored the agreement and, after the annexation of Crimea he supported separatists in eastern Ukraine to give the government in Kyiv something else to worry about. So far, almost 14,000 people have been killed in the Donbas war. President Zelensky has lamented the fact that Crimea has never been part of the efforts to settle the Donbas conflict in the earlier Minsk accords or what are called “the Normandy format” talks, even though they are now held in Paris. He said recently he hopes that the upcoming round will offer “at least” the chance to bring Crimea back into the discussion. But in truth, as Putin certainly expected, much of the world is coming to accept Russia’s annexation of Crimea as irreversible, a fait accompli. The latest incremental appeasement of Moscow: Apple now shows Crimea as Russian territory on its map and weather apps—but only when viewed from Russia.More troubling for Kyiv and many of its supporters in the West, U.S. President Donald Trump, who wants to be friends with Putin and, we recently learned, really does not like Ukraine, seems to be leaving the door open to U.S. and international acceptance of Moscow’s dominion over Crimea. Russia was expelled from the G8 in 2014 as one of several measures, including economic sanctions, taken by Europe and the U.S. to punish the Kremlin for its aggression. In August this year, Trump argued Russia should be let back into the G8 club, suggesting the only reason it was expelled was because an “embarrassed” President Barack Obama was “outsmarted by Putin” when Crimea was “taken away from President Obama,” as if it had somehow belonged to the United States in the first place. * * *NAME CHANGES* * *Through the generations, Crimea’s heroes and its perspectives on their place in history have ebbed and flowed like the waves of the Black Sea. Three decades after the end of the Crimean War, the Russian Empire named a street after Admiral Nakhimov.  But 34 years after that, the Bolsheviks’ October Revolution destroyed the old Russian Empire and the street lost its name again.  Our guide pointed at Grafskaya Dock, another historical spot in Sevastopol. After years of fighting, the Reds had pushed Russian nobility and the White Army south to Crimea.  Almost a century ago, on a chilly, grim November morning in 1920, Russian General Petr Vrangel, the last commander of the White Army, arrived at Grafskaya Dock to inspect the ships with noble families waiting to flee from the Bolsheviks’ terror. The British and French military now helped to evacuate more than 150,000 Russian refugees and soldiers to Turkey. The Bolsheviks for a time renamed Nakhimov Street after Leon Trotsky, but he was soon out of favor, out of Russia, and murdered in exile in Mexico. And when the Soviets finally renamed the street after Nakhimov in 1946, there was very little of Sevastopol left.During World War II, Nazi aviation destroyed the city, leaving fewer than a dozen of the buildings that dated to the reign of Catherine the Great. Soviet leader Josef Stalin then reconstructed Sevastopol’s white edifices.* * *THE SECOND COLD WAR* * *There was no place to exchange foreign currency on the weekend before Unity Day, a Russian national holiday. One could hardly think of another place in Europe where a foreign tourist loaded with U.S. dollars and euros could not pay for a hotel. “Thank the anti-Russian sanctions,” said the receptionist at the elegant Hotel Sevastopol. Since 2014, the flow of Western tourists to Sevastopol has been fading away but the city museums are still filled with Russian–and Ukrainian–visitors. In spite of the Donbas conflict and the U.S. and European Union economic sanctions, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian tourists still travel to Crimea every year; in all, more than six million tourists visited Crimea last year. But American writers and historians who come here experience something of the Cold War, or rather “the Second Cold War,” as our Sevastopol taxi driver joked. Discussions with American journalists by Russian border guards are routine at the checkpoint where one crosses the line from Ukraine; and it can take some time. A majority of Crimea’s tourists violate Ukrainian law, which considers Crimea to be Ukrainian territory. Instead they fly here from Russian airports or drive across the new bridge opened in May 2018 which Moscow now uses to assert control over the militarily and commercially important Sea of Azov. * * *TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES* * *On a recent weekend, dozens of teenagers in blue uniforms who had visited the former Soviet Pioneer Camp Artek came to explore Panorama, the Crimean War museum.Every day Alexander Kuts shows visitors around the museum and speaks of Crimea’s tragic and heroic history. “If you want to know why so much blood spilled on this land, just look at the map: if you control Crimea, you control the Black Sea,” he tells them. Battles have torn this place apart since the 2nd century BC, when Greeks founded the port city of Chersonesus in the outskirts of  what is modern Sevastopol. People died in battles for the peninsula during the Crimean Khanate from 1441 until Catherine the Great’s conquest in 1783 and beyond. In living memory, more than 250,000 Soviet soldiers died defending Sevastopol against the Nazi German and Romanian onslaught in 1941-1942. But the central attraction of the museum is a giant painting of the 349-day defense of Sevastopol and the high Malakoff redoubt. We keep turning back to pages from the 1850s. Two great writers, the British journalist William Howard Russell and the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy had learned from the horrors of Crimea just how much they hated war and the deadly follies of those who prosecuted it.Kings, sultans, tsars, emperors and empresses—they were playing a game of nations with rules inherited from conflicts 40 years, 50 years or a century before. But the death-dealing technology of artillery and riflery had changed dramatically, but the care and feeding of soldiers had not. The combined death toll on all sides in the Crimean War would reach 900,000, mostly from disease and neglect.Crimea in 1854 was right on the cusp of what would become modern industrialized warfare, the kind that killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of Americans five years later in the Civil War and reached its apotheosis in the vast carnage of World War I and World War II.How had the Crimean war begun? With the great powers of the time colliding in the Holy Land.Tsar Nicholas I, harboring imperial ambitions similar to those that Voltaire had admired in Catherine the Great, wanted to push into Ottoman realms, and demanded protection for Orthodox Christians on the territories controlled by the Sultan as well as privileges for the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, especially in Jerusalem. In November 1853, as tensions mounted, a Russian naval squadron attacked and soundly defeated Ottoman warships at anchor in an Anatolian harbor. The French, British, and Sardinians, concerned about broader Russian ambitions, decided to throw their weight behind the Turks. The two great witnesses of the Crimean war, Tolstoy on the Russian side and  William Howard Russell with the British and French, both described the suffering of the soldiers, but it would be Russell’s account of the incredible bravery and utter folly of a British charge directly into the mouths of Russian heavy artillery during the battle of Balaclava in October 1854 that electrified the British public. A vague order issued by a geriatric British general had been misinterpreted by the commander on the ground, who led his men to certain death. The British Light Horse cavalry had begun its advance at “ten minutes past eleven,” Russell wrote at the beginning of his account of his battle. The Russian guns decimated them, but still they charged on. “The first line is broken, it is joined by the second, they never hold or check their speed an instant,” wrote Russell, who could see the battle clearly from a hillside among the commanding officers. “With diminished ranks, thinned by those 30 guns, which the Russians had laid with the most deadly accuracy, with a halo of flashing steel above their heads, and with a cheer that was many a noble fellow’s death-cry, they flew into the smoke of the batteries, but ere they were lost from view the plain was strewn with their bodies and with the carcasses of horses. … At thirty-five minutes past eleven not a British soldier, except the dead and dying, was left in front of those bloody Muscovite guns.”Ever since, schoolchildren in Britain and in the United States as well have read the pounding rhythms of Alfred Lord Tennyson’s poem, “The Charge of the Light Brigade” as a paean to bravery, even though the battle was a paradigm of stupidity.“Forward, the Light Brigade!”Was there a man dismayed?Not though the soldier knew   Someone had blundered.   Theirs not to make reply,   Theirs not to reason why,   Theirs but to do and die.   Into the valley of Death   Rode the six hundred.Vineyards grow today all over the field where October 25, 1854, the cavalry swept past Russell “in all the pride and splendor of war” to inspire with their sacrifice the British and American imagination.  But few in Crimea know the exact location for the memorial at the scene. A small white stela is hiding among the rows of grapes. The fading words on the monument’s foundation commemorate “officers and men” who charged with the Light Brigade at Balaclava. The plaque was installed here in October 2004, the 150th anniversary of the battle, by His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, but judging by the peeling paint, the monument has been abandoned ever since. Compared to the French and Turkish cemeteries here, the British graveyard looks absolutely heartbreaking: an ugly, trashed-filled field surrounded with small private homes.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Look No Further Than the Family Trump for the Answer","summary":"Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/GettyDonald Trump, Jr. cruised into the Thanksgiving weekend on the heels of an enormous literary triumph. His opus Triggered had spent two solid weeks on the top of The New York Times non-fiction best seller list. Junior’s run ended this week when he was knocked off by A Warning. But despite this displacement, Triggered represents a triumph for the young scribe, who has now accomplished something on his own. His father’s namesake is, finally, not a failson. What’s a failson (pronounced exactly like it looks, just a combination of “fail” and “son”)? He is an upper- (or upper-middle) class incompetent who is protected by familial wealth from the consequences of his actions. The term seems to have been coined by one Will Menaker of the podcast Chapo Trap House, as documented in The New Yorker in this 2016 article. One is not born a failson. Nor does one simply inherit the status of failson. No—failson status is earned through a display of equal parts incompetence, stupidity, and arrogance. And until his book, no person in America—or maybe even the world, so bursting at the seams with louche heirs and dissolute royals with no throne to sit their pampered arses on—illustrated all the facets of a failson better than Junior.Donald Trump Jr. Went on ‘The View’ and It Was a Total ShitshowBut wait! Those pesky Federal Election Commission disclosers show that the Republican National Committee spent $94,000 on copies of Junior’s literary debut. The New York Times’ Nick Confessore notes that “new FEC disclosures show a single large RNC payment of $94,800 to Books-a-Million in October, a few days before Triggered was released. An RNC spokesman confirmed that the expenditure was connected to their promotion of Don Trump Jr.&#39;s book.”So this means that junior is actually still a failson. In fact, one might say there is no greater expression of failson-ness than needing Daddy’s party’s political arm to bulk-buy your book. The New York Times denotes such bulk sales with an asterisk to let readers know that the sales were not organic. Junior, never one to be deterred by facts, immediately declared that this was part of a larger Times conspiracy against him. “I guess that’s their way of exerting a little bit of revenge by putting an asterisk without getting into the details,” he sniffed. Yes Junior, The New York Times bulk purchasing policy is actually a conspiracy against you, the president’s large adult failson. Another interesting failson protection that Junior enjoys is a free pass on all his alleged crimes. He was deemed in essence too stupid to collude by Robert Mueller. Harry Sandick, a former federal prosecutor, told Bloomberg News, “For a willful violation, you must know that what you are doing violates some known legal duty.” Since Junior didn’t understand the law, he was given a pass on knowingly breaking it.But Junior is not alone in his failson status. Never in American history have we had an administration so chockablock full of failsons. The Trump administration boasts a panoply of failsons unrivaled since the days of King George. Jared Kushner is the failson in chief, arguably worse than Junior. After crushing a newspaper and overpaying for the aptly named 666 Fifth Avenue, the failson-in-law decided to take a crack at governmenting. He was tasked with peace in the Middle East and also renegotiating NAFTA, handling the opioid crisis, modernizing the Veterans Administration, spearheading criminal justice reform, and WhatsApp messaging with Saudi Arabian failson Mohammed bin Salman. But when those things proved too complicated for the young polymath, his father-in-law decided to refocus him on the important things, like why Matt Drudge was mad at him, tasking Ivanka’s husband to “look into it” and find out why Drudge has forsaken him. More recently, Jared was asked by his father-in-law to take another crack at building the wall. But Jared is just one of many White House failsons. Eric Trump is, of course, another. Not as notorious as his dimwitted siblings, Eric is the one of the Trump litter who seems the most interested in running the family’s mediocre hotel business. Though Eric always enjoys doing a segment on Fox News, where he dishes out really hot takes like his assessment that “Democrats weren’t even people.” Eric is also extremely bad at Twitter. On Thanksgiving Day, he tweeted a picture of a red hat emblazoned with the acronym LOPA for “Leave Our President Alone,” which caused the internet to erupt in mockery of the young Hapsburg. Finally, the president’s free lawyer has a failson, Andrew, who works for the administration earning $90,000 a year. His chief responsibility seem to be largely “having a nice time.” But lest you think this is a nepotism hire, Rudy assured The Atlantic’s Elaina Plott, “Now, did he know him in the first place because he was the mayor’s son? Sure, but they also had a relationship independent of me.” That relationship, according to a source who knows about it, includes many rounds of golf over the years. Golf is something Andrew’s actually good at, but it doesn’t mean he belongs in the White House.The Trump administration has even become a safe harbor for the failsons of outsiders: Trump humper Hugh Hewitt’s failson James is comfortably ensconced in the State Department after serving as press secretary for fossil-fuel enthusiast and noted apartment hunter Scott Pruitt. You may remember this story because Hugh got in trouble for defending his son’s boss on TV without disclosing the relationship. Why do failsons do so well in the Trump administration? For one thing, the administration doesn’t actually do much, so in that way it sticks to the core values of failsonishness. But mainly, the failson administration is headed by the most failsonish president ever. Donald Trump is the definition of a failson, an incompetent continually saved from himself by his wealthy father. He inherited nearly $500 million from his pop, all the while claiming he was completely self-made. After his father died, Trump found other patrons, and he now enjoys the largesse of the lobbyists, and various foreign rogues like Vladimir Putin and Julian Assange, who helped put him in the White House. The failson Trump administration is the best advertisement for raising sky-high estate taxes and crushing the culture of failsons for one and all. After all, why should failsons be a protected species like the California condor or the giant sea bass? Let them go the way of the rotary phone and the telegram, let them fade into the footnotes of history, a capitalist punchline. Jimmy Kimmel Unloads on Donald Trump Jr. for ‘Smearing’ Alexander VindmanRead more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

They require new phone plan users to submit face scans alongside their national identification card information, ensuring their devices are linked to their real identities. The MIIT said the move was made &quot;to safeguard the legitimate rights and interest of citizens in cyberspace&quot;, and would help protect phone users from fraud.  With Chinese authorities cracking down hard on online dissent and arresting government critics, there are concerns that the regulations mark the next step in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)&#39;s construction of the world&#39;s most draconian surveillance regime. Debate about the government’s intent with regard to the new requirement was sparked on Chinese social media sites, such as Weibo. China&#39;s President Xi Jinping  Credit: AFP One commenter pointed out that real-name registration of phone plans with ID cards had been a requirement in China for years already. “Scam and sales phone calls still have not been stopped!” they wrote in a post translated by Quartz. “Gathering citizen’s information excessively like this is a violation of people’s civic rights.” The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) heavily censors the internet in China, which has over 850 million mobile internet users. Many news and social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are blocked by what has come to be known as ‘The Great Firewall’. Chinese authorities have invested heavily in face recognition technology recently, as part of measures to keep close tabs on the population.

They require new phone plan users to submit face scans alongside their national identification card information, ensuring their devices are linked to their real identities. The MIIT said the move was made &quot;to safeguard the legitimate rights and interest of citizens in cyberspace&quot;, and would help protect phone users from fraud.  With Chinese authorities cracking down hard on online dissent and arresting government critics, there are concerns that the regulations mark the next step in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)&#39;s construction of the world&#39;s most draconian surveillance regime. Debate about the government’s intent with regard to the new requirement was sparked on Chinese social media sites, such as Weibo. China&#39;s President Xi Jinping  Credit: AFP One commenter pointed out that real-name registration of phone plans with ID cards had been a requirement in China for years already. “Scam and sales phone calls still have not been stopped!” they wrote in a post translated by Quartz. “Gathering citizen’s information excessively like this is a violation of people’s civic rights.” The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) heavily censors the internet in China, which has over 850 million mobile internet users. Many news and social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are blocked by what has come to be known as ‘The Great Firewall’. Chinese authorities have invested heavily in face recognition technology recently, as part of measures to keep close tabs on the population. There are reportedly 200 million surveillance cameras operating in the country. The government is also developing a social credit system that will rate citizens on factors including loyalty to the CCP. The system, scheduled to be fully implemented by 2020, results in punishments such as transport restrictions for citizens with low scores.","url":"https://news.yahoo.com/china-makes-face-scanning-compulsory-131245955.html","date":"2019-12-01T13:12:45.000Z","id":1260},"1261":{"title":"Revealed: Woman killed in terror attack was ex-Cambridge student","summary":"The woman killed in the London Bridge terror attack was a former University of Cambridge student, its vice chancellor has said.","description":"The woman killed in the London Bridge terror attack was a former University of Cambridge student, its vice chancellor has said.","url":"http://news.sky.com/story/revealed-woman-killed-in-terror-attack-was-former-cambridge-university-student-11875401","date":"2019-12-01T13:36:00.000Z","id":1261},"1262":{"title":"Moment Yazidi former sex slave comes face to face with ISIS rapist who attacked her when she was 14","summary":"EXCLUSIVE: Ashwaq Hajji Hameed was kidnapped, sold into slavery and abused at the age of 14, but started a new life in Europe after fleeing ISIS - only for her slaver to bump into her in Germany.","description":"EXCLUSIVE: Ashwaq Hajji Hameed was kidnapped, sold into slavery and abused at the age of 14, but started a new life in Europe after fleeing ISIS - only for her slaver to bump into her in Germany.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7743453/Moment-Yazidi-former-sex-slave-comes-face-face-ISIS-rapist-attacked-14.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","date":"2019-12-01T13:44:01.000Z","id":1262},"1263":{"title":"Norwich City v Arsenal: Premier League – live!","summary":"Updates from the 2pm GMT kick-off at Carrow RoadLive scores: Wolves v Sheffield United and moreEmail Ben here and tweet @benfisherj 1.44pm GMT A gentle reminder Wolves v Sheffield United also gets under way at 2pm (GMT) at Molineux.

I answered it. I thought he had asked me if Ukraine had meddled in the 2016 election,” the Republican senator replied, reiterating previous excuses he had given. “He didn’t, he asked me if Ukraine was responsible for hacking the DNC computer, which is, of course, a form of meddling. I went back and looked at the transcript and I realized Chris was right and I was wrong so I said I was wrong.”The NBC News host went on to note that the main criticism Kennedy has faced in recent days is that he is conflating what Russia and Ukraine did during the 2016 election, stating that Kennedy appears to be doing President Trump’s “dirty work” for him.Kennedy, meanwhile, insisted that there was sufficient evidence that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election on behalf of Clinton, citing a handful of articles to claim that a number of Ukrainian officials “meddled in the election on social media and otherwise.” “In fact, in December of 2018, a Ukrainian court ruled that Ukrainian officials had violated Ukrainian law by meddling in our election and that was reported in The New York Times,” Kennedy added, referencing a court ruling that the leaking of the so-called “black ledger” on ex-Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort was against the law. (The court has since canceled that ruling.)Todd would eventually confront Kennedy on the U.S. intelligence community, recently briefing lawmakers that attempts to frame Ukraine for Russian election meddling was actually “a Russian intelligence propaganda campaign in order to get people like you to say these things about Ukraine.” “When does opinion become fact?” Todd wondered aloud. “Does 17 intelligence services saying it, does every western intelligence ally saying Russia did this—I get sort of confused at what point is it no longer an opinion for you?”After once again noting that a Ukrainian court “smacked down several Ukrainian officials for meddling in our elections,” Kennedy then made a claim that gobsmacked the Meet the Press host.“Russia was very aggressive and they’re much more sophisticated,” the conservative senator declared. “But the fact that Russia was so aggressive does not exclude the fact that President Poroshenko actively worked for Secretary Clinton.”“Actively worked for Secretary Clinton?! My goodness, wait a minute, Senator Kennedy,” Todd shot back. “You now have the president of Ukraine saying he worked for the Democratic nominee for president. C’mon. You realize, the only other person selling this argument outside the United States is this man, Vladimir Putin!”The NBC host then highlighted the Russian president recently boasting that “nobody is accusing us anymore of interfering in U.S. election” but instead blaming Ukraine.Todd further pushed back on Kennedy’s assertion, asking him if he believed that Ukrainian officials criticizing Trump during the election over his endorsement of Russia’s annexation of Crimea was equivalent to Russia’s hacking.Kennedy, for his part, said that there would be no harm allowing President Trump to “introduce evidence” that could support these assertions since Trump “has a demonstrated record fighting foreign corruption.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Their victory in the membership poll will soon be formalised by party delegates. Speaking to broadcaster ARD, Ms Esken held her cards close to her chest on whether she intends to walk out on the coalition, something that would accelerate the end of Chancellor Merkel’s career. But she made clear that she saw the coalition as damaging her party and German democracy, with both parties having to make compromises that alienated supporters.  “We’ve seen both big parties lose a lot due to the coalition, so we both have an interest in governing in other alliances,” Ms Esken said. The Chancellor could be forced into early retirement Credit: REX The new leadership will set out their plans at the party conference over the coming weekend, where delegates will vote on several decisions key to the country’s immediate future including whether to stay in the coalition until 2021. Ms Esken has suggested she would be willing to stay in the pact but only if the CDU agreed to half a trillion euros in public spending on key infrastructure over the next decade. Such a huge spending package would mean blowing up the centre-right party&#39;s hallowed “schwarze null” spending rules, which commit Berlin to maintaining a balanced budget. With Germany’s economy stagnating, a growing chorus of economists and left-wing politicians have called for the government to make use of historically low interest rates and increase investment in roads, rail infrastructure and schools via new debts. But the CDU’s economic council warned the party leadership on Sunday not to “give in to the SPD’s utopian demands only for the sake of staying in power.” Mrs Merkel&#39;s would-be successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, urged the Social Democrats on Sunday to remain part of the government  but ruled out re-negotiating their agreement. “For the CDU it is quite clear: we stand by this coalition,” she said. “We stand by this coalition on the basis that has been negotiated.“ Several CDU heavyweights also made clear they were in no mood to talk, with one dismissing the SPD as being in “self-destruction mode.”  If the SPD walk out, the most likely outcome would be the CDU going it alone as a minority government under Ms Merkel or new elections being called for next year. Such an outcome would mean the end of the veteran Chancellor&#39;s rule. The power struggle inside the SPD is set to continue at party conference where moderates, who had to swallow an 8 percent defeat for their candidates, will seek to balance the leftists’ new strength by winning elections for the vacant deputy leader positions. The SPD has been without a leader since June when Andrea Nahles resigned after a poor showing in the European elections and months of desperate polling figures.","description":"Germany’s ruling coalition is facing collapse after the new leader of the junior partner to Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) branded the parties&#39; long-standing arrangement “crap for democracy”.  The leftist duo of Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans won a shock victory to take control of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) party on Saturday, defeating a centrist pair led by finance minister Olaf Scholz.

The situation is in sharp contrast to countries that Venezuelan leaders have held up as role models -- Cuba and Russia -- both of which have managed to shelter the primary education system from the worst effects of a comparable downturn in the 1990s.Students began skipping school in Venezuela shortly after President Nicolas Maduro came to power in 2013. A fall in the price of the country&#39;s main export, crude oil, combined with Maduro&#39;s ill-timed effort to double down on price and currency controls sent the economy into a recession from which it has not yet emerged.Some Venezuelan children are staying home because many schools have stopped providing meals or because their parents can no longer afford uniforms, school utensils or bus fares. Others have joined parents in one of the world&#39;s biggest displacement crises: About 4 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, according to the United Nations.Thousands of the country&#39;s 550,000 teachers did not show up for classes when schools reopened in September, according to the national teachers union, ditching their $8-a-month wages to try their luck abroad or in Venezuela&#39;s booming illegal gold mines.In Venezuela&#39;s most-populous state, Zulia, up to 60% of about 65,000 teachers have deserted in recent years, according to estimates by Alexander Castro, head of the local teachers union.&quot;They tell us that they prefer painting nails for a few dollars than work for a minimum wage,&quot; Castro said.To keep schools going, the remaining teachers often teach all of the subjects or combine different school years in one classroom. Nearly all of the one dozen schools visited have slashed working hours; some open for only a day or two a week.In the village of Parmana in Venezuela&#39;s central plains, only 4 out of 150 registered students attended school in October. The four students, of varying ages, sat in the same dilapidated classroom without electricity, practicing everything from the alphabet to algebra as the school&#39;s sole remaining teacher tried to encourage them with a dejected smile.The rest of the village&#39;s children have joined their parents in the fields and fishing boats to help feed their families.In the country&#39;s second biggest city of Maracaibo, a sign outside a dilapidated school without electricity recently read: &quot;Please come to classes, even without uniforms.&quot; The children ask teachers at the entrance if there is food before deciding whether to come in.Maracaibo&#39;s biggest school no longer has any functioning bathrooms.

She tried taking up studies again at a local community center, but its teachers stopped showing up after two weeks of classes.She now spends her time taking care of her 1-year-old son.&quot;I want to learn to do the math and read and write rapidly. I&#39;m scared that when my son grows and starts asking questions, I won&#39;t know how to respond. But right now, we don&#39;t even have enough to eat.&quot;This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company","url":"https://news.yahoo.com/students-fainting-hunger-venezuelas-failing-170242080.html","date":"2019-12-01T17:02:42.000Z","id":1521},"1522":{"title":"Israel plans new settler homes in flashpoint West Bank city","summary":"Israel’s new defense minister has ordered plans for new settler housing in the volatile West Bank city of Hebron.

Von der Leyen will pitch this plan to envoys from more than 200 nations on Monday when she travels to Madrid to take part in the opening of the United Nations climate talks. It will be her first event in the role, in which she started her five-year term on Sunday.“The European Union wants to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050,” she told reporters on Sunday in Brussels. “Europe is leading in this topic and we know that we have to be ambitious for our planet but also to be a front-runner.”The climate neutrality goal is estimated to require an extra 175 billion euros ($193 billion) to 290 billion euros a year in investment for energy systems and infrastructure from 2030.Von der Leyen set the Green Deal project as a top priority for her tenure. It would affect areas from energy production to transport and agriculture, putting Europe in sync with the objectives of the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in the global temperature.The move would also put the EU ahead of other major emitters, including China, India and Japan, which have yet to translate their voluntary Paris pledges into binding national measures. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris agreement in 2017.The climate policy will be part of the “geopolitical commission” concept von der Leyen intends to pursue to ensure Europe’s voice is heard on the same level as the likes of China and the U.S. The strategy will encourage other countries to follow suit by flagging options like a carbon tariff to be imposed on nations which fall behind.Von der Leyen held several calls on her first day with a number of leaders, including Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.“The good news is that China says that they are aware of climate change,” von der Leyen said. “The fact that China is introducing an emissions trading system shows that it is also a topic that is high on the agenda in China.”More details on the Green Deal are expected on Dec. 11, including a document outlining plans for a Just Transition Fund designed to help the countries impacted the most by the emission-reduction policy.To contact the reporter on this story: Ewa Krukowska in Brussels at ekrukowska@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Reed Landberg at landberg@bloomberg.net, Sam Unsted, James AmottFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","description":"(Bloomberg) -- The European Union will challenge the U.S. and China on climate-change targets as the fight against global warming becomes a major international issue, according to new European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.The EU is considering a target to bring emission levels down to zero by the middle of this century in its bid to lead the push to reduce greenhouse gases.

Money is, of course, a perennial problem, and I doubt any English writer has written so wittily and recognisably about the absence of readies since Lezard’s hero Orwell.

Partly, as Lezard assures us in a rueful, funny introduction, because his life did indeed worsen dramatically after this collection of pieces was written (around 2012-14), and because, even by the end here, things have gone awry. He talks about how we are subject to the Boethian wheel of fate, which “can have you the toppermost of the poppermost at one moment, and down among the garbage the next”. The rubbish here is both literal – the Hovel has not earned its name because of its cleanly mien – and metaphorical.

The NATO summit provides an opportunity to reinforce that — opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn is a lifelong antiwar campaigner who has criticized the alliance. Corbyn says the Tories’ spending cuts resulted in the prison service wrongly releasing the attacker.Impeachment heats up | The U.S. House — faced with a sharply divided public, a compressed timetable and doubts about White House participation — this week begins the task of deciding whether to bring articles of impeachment against Trump. As the case moves to the Judiciary Committee, it’s a chance for the Democrats to synthesize weeks of testimony into a convincing narrative.Click here for an explanation of the wild cards Trump would face during an impeachment trial in the Republican-led Senate.Pulling punches | China vowed to sanction some American rights organizations and halt warship visits to Hong Kong in response to Trump’s decision to sign legislation supporting the city’s protesters. The move appeared designed to avoid further economic damage both to China, which is in trade talks with the U.S., and Hong Kong, which saw retail sales suffer a record drop in October as almost six months of unrest drags down growth.The Maltese problem | Joseph Muscat has agreed to step down as prime minister after his closest aides were tied to a car bomb attack that killed an investigative journalist. But he does intend to stay in office until his party has picked a successor — in January at the earliest. That may not be good enough for those demanding a proper probe of suspected links between the murderers and the government.Tough audience | Joe Biden is working to breathe new life into his campaign in Iowa, a state where he’s struggled to keep up with his competitors despite leading the crowded 2020 field of Democratic contenders in most national polls. Biden kicked off an eight-day bus tour on the weekend that focuses on rural areas, and he’s enlisting the help of a popular ex-governor.What to Watch This WeekChancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition was thrown into crisis after the Social Democrats elected a new left-leaning leadership seen as a threat to the survival of the government. All eyes are on China as negotiators from nearly 200 nations head to Madrid for United Nations climate talks. Delegates are quietly building a legal framework to support money aimed at guiding the world in a greener direction. The U.S. will announce today what retaliatory action, if any, it will take in response to a digital tax France instituted this year that will hit large American tech companies. The Supreme Court hears arguments today on New York City’s curbs on the transportation of licensed handguns, the first time in more than a decade it considers a case dealing with the reach of the Second Amendment. Russia’s eastward pivot deepened today with the opening of a pipeline that will deliver as much as 38 billion cubic meters of gas annually to China under a 30-year contract. Namibian President Hage Geingob has won a second term despite the worst performance yet for his party amid a stuttering economy.Thanks to all who responded to our pop quiz Friday and congratulations to reader Lee Lambert, who was the first to name Crimea as the territory that Apple identified in its Maps application as part of Russia instead of Ukraine.

The NATO summit provides an opportunity to reinforce that — opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn is a lifelong antiwar campaigner who has criticized the alliance. Corbyn says the Tories’ spending cuts resulted in the prison service wrongly releasing the attacker.Impeachment heats up | The U.S. House — faced with a sharply divided public, a compressed timetable and doubts about White House participation — this week begins the task of deciding whether to bring articles of impeachment against Trump. As the case moves to the Judiciary Committee, it’s a chance for the Democrats to synthesize weeks of testimony into a convincing narrative.Click here for an explanation of the wild cards Trump would face during an impeachment trial in the Republican-led Senate.Pulling punches | China vowed to sanction some American rights organizations and halt warship visits to Hong Kong in response to Trump’s decision to sign legislation supporting the city’s protesters. The move appeared designed to avoid further economic damage both to China, which is in trade talks with the U.S., and Hong Kong, which saw retail sales suffer a record drop in October as almost six months of unrest drags down growth.The Maltese problem | Joseph Muscat has agreed to step down as prime minister after his closest aides were tied to a car bomb attack that killed an investigative journalist. But he does intend to stay in office until his party has picked a successor — in January at the earliest. That may not be good enough for those demanding a proper probe of suspected links between the murderers and the government.Tough audience | Joe Biden is working to breathe new life into his campaign in Iowa, a state where he’s struggled to keep up with his competitors despite leading the crowded 2020 field of Democratic contenders in most national polls. Biden kicked off an eight-day bus tour on the weekend that focuses on rural areas, and he’s enlisting the help of a popular ex-governor.What to Watch This WeekChancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition was thrown into crisis after the Social Democrats elected a new left-leaning leadership seen as a threat to the survival of the government. All eyes are on China as negotiators from nearly 200 nations head to Madrid for United Nations climate talks. Delegates are quietly building a legal framework to support money aimed at guiding the world in a greener direction. The U.S. will announce today what retaliatory action, if any, it will take in response to a digital tax France instituted this year that will hit large American tech companies. The Supreme Court hears arguments today on New York City’s curbs on the transportation of licensed handguns, the first time in more than a decade it considers a case dealing with the reach of the Second Amendment. Russia’s eastward pivot deepened today with the opening of a pipeline that will deliver as much as 38 billion cubic meters of gas annually to China under a 30-year contract. Namibian President Hage Geingob has won a second term despite the worst performance yet for his party amid a stuttering economy.Thanks to all who responded to our pop quiz Friday and congratulations to reader Lee Lambert, who was the first to name Crimea as the territory that Apple identified in its Maps application as part of Russia instead of Ukraine. Tell us how we’re doing or what we’re missing at balancepower@bloomberg.net.And finally ... Perhaps only in Japan can the cherry blossom become the source of political intrigue. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has seen his poll numbers slide in recent weeks amid questions about whether he rewarded supporters with invitations to a publicly funded party to behold the botanical beauty of Japan’s national flower. The scandal deepened after revelations that key documents including the guest list were shredded. &#92;--With assistance from Daniel Ten Kate, Brendan Scott, Alex Morales and Ben Sills.To contact the author of this story: Rosalind Mathieson in London at rmathieson3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Kathleen Hunter at khunter9@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https://news.yahoo.com/london-showdown-looms-nato-frenemies-105007844.html","date":"2019-12-02T10:50:07.000Z","id":1731},"1732":{"title":"Merkel’s Party Plays Hardball With Coalition Future in Doubt","summary":"(Bloomberg) -- Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party told the new leadership of the Social Democrats that there will be no renegotiation of the terms of their alliance and they can quit the governing coalition if they can’t accept that.The SPD on Saturday picked government critics Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken to take the party forward over Merkel’s Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Ten minutes into the flight, the plane’s captain reported unusual readings on the Fuel Quantity Indication System (FQIS). Two minutes after that, a catastrophic explosion occurred. TWA 800 broke apart mid-air into three huge sections that came crashing into the sea. People on the South Shore of Long Island would report seeing the fireball in the night. Others reported seeing lights streaking across the sky around the same time as the explosion.Mueller, Barr, Giuliani, Comey and Kallstrom Once Fought Terror Together—Now Trump Has Them Fight Each OtherAlongside the work of the National Transportation Safety Board, the FBI launched an investigation led by the assistant director for the New York field office, James Kallstrom. Until recently, he was defined in history as the man who headed that $20 million, 16-month investigation into the explosion—and who kept conspiracy theories from spinning out of control. And that was no easy task. Pierre Salinger, President John F. Kennedy’s former press secretary, was reporting from France that he had secret information that the plane had been brought down by the friendly fire of a U.S. Navy missile, and that theory has never been completely exorcised from the popular imagination.Despite the fact that all the bodies or fragments of bodies were recovered from the murky ocean depths, and despite the fact that almost all of the airplane had been found and reconstructed in a hangar on Long Island where it underwent hundreds of hours of forensic investigation, suspicions remain to this day concerning the veracity of the final judgment that an explosion in the central fuel tank caused TWA 800 to break apart in mid-air before crashing into the sea.To his credit, Kallstrom personally poured significant emotional energy into dealing with distraught family members. But more recently Kallstrom—who once fought against conspiracy theories—has gone off the rails sacrificing his once sound judgment at the altar of Donald Trump. Enter Rudy Giuliani. The friendship of Kallstrom and Giuliani goes back to the 1970s when Giuliani was a young prosecutor and Kallstrom was a supervisory special agent in the FBI’s New York field office. By the late 1980s, Kallstrom was a well-known surveillance expert who designed the complex bugging operations during the famous New York Pizza Connection investigation and the John Gotti investigation. These were cases worked on by both Giuliani and Louis Freeh, both at the Southern District of New York at the time. Kallstrom was their leading wiretap guy, and the three of them bonded. Later, in the 1990s, when Kallstrom headed the FBI’s New York field office, Giuliani was the city’s mayor. By the mid-1990s the distrust and dislike of Bill and Hillary Clinton that flowed from the FBI leadership down to the rank-and-file was well established. It had been in existence from the minute Bill Clinton won the Democratic nomination to run against the incumbent, President George H.W. Bush. Rumors had begun circulating among federal agents that Hillary was rude and nasty to her Secret Service detail, and that she and her husband hated cops. There were women coming forward accusing Bill Clinton of harassment and rape. Hillary was accused of corruption at her old law firm in Arkansas.When Hillary got ready to run for president in 2016 and was heavily favored to win, the anti-Clinton sentiment had been festering in the Bureau for over two decades, and Giuliani and Kallstrom were well positioned to exploit it. Each man had tentacles still deep inside the Bureau, and as they looked for ways to stop Hillary a sort of cabal developed that included current as well as former FBI agents. * * *ABOUT THOSE EMAILS* * *Hillary Clinton’s detractors in the FBI may have believed they’d finally found the kryptonite needed to put an end to her political career. The State Department inspector general had discovered that as secretary of state, Clinton had installed a personal email server in her home over which she conducted the country’s business. Some of the correspondence was deemed classified and thus she was technically in violation of the law. A personal server gave Clinton more individual control over her email traffic and led to many conspiracy theories as to what she actually was up to. It also gave her control over what she finally turned over—or not—during the subsequent investigation.It&#39;s worth reviewing what that was all about, since many readers may have lost track during the countless speeches and tirades that invoke &quot;the emails&quot; one way or another.Anyone who has spent many years working in government, and especially on classified systems of any kind, will tell you they are notoriously unreliable, often failing over some glitch or shutdown due to “upgrades.” And then there is the notoriously bad classification process. Tons of information comes in daily, much of it needs to be shared, often that means going through a time consuming process to change a document’s classification. In many cases that means having to go back to the “original source” of the information. It can take days. The frustrations with BlackBerrys and cellphones invite even more potential screw ups.Lisa Page Speaks: ‘There’s No Fathomable Way I Have Committed Any Crime at All’But one thing is clear, as inconvenient as it is, everyone in government dealing with classified information knows it is the height of stupidity to ever mix personal correspondence with official business over any government device. (The unfortunate fate of the FBI&#39;s Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, scapegoated and humiliated by President Trump after some indiscreet text messagers, is a cautionary example.)And one of the primary reasons to be incredibly careful and compliant with regulations—as inconvenient as they often are—is that any violation discovered will be the weapon your enemies will use to discredit you or even to end your career. Everyone screws up at one time or another, but what might be handled with an internal administrative action (if no criminal law was broken) can suddenly turn into a career-ending scandal in the hands of your enemies. Hillary Clinton found this out the hard way. Years before, in 2001, so did the FBI’s counterterrorism chief, John O’Neill, when a security violation was leaked to the press by someone in the Bureau who wanted him out. His career was ruined. And his infraction was nothing compared to Secretary of State Clinton&#39;s.Hillary Clinton’s bad judgment and the question of what happened to some of the emails from the private server led to interminable Republican allegations and investigations in Congress trying to establish some criminal intent. “The emails!” became a common refrain at Trump campaign rallies, often culminating in the chant, “Lock her up!”Then, on July 5, 2016, at the height of the presidential race, FBI Director James Comey took the unusual step of announcing that a year of meticulous investigation had turned up a few classified needles in the haystack of emails Clinton turned over, but, “We did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information,” Comey said, even though “there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.” Bottom line: no prosecution. Trump wouldn’t let the issue drop, however, focusing on the question of what happened to emails that supposedly were erased or, in any case, were not turned over to the FBI.At the end of July 2016, Trump famously suggested, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 [Hillary Clinton] emails that are missing.” And perhaps by coincidence, perhaps not, on that very same day Russian hackers made their first effort to break into servers being used by candidate Clinton’s personal office, according to indictments obtained by by the Mueller investigation. Russian intelligence passed thousands of email obtained through hacks of the Democratic National Committee to WikiLeaks, and Trump happily exploited the stolen correspondence.When, in October 2016, the FBI came into possession of some Hillary emails that it had not seen previously, the threat of a possible leak from the FBI was continuing to put pressure on Comey, and just 11 days before the election he made the controversial decision to go public about the fact the emails existed, rather than their content, which proved to be banal. Former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told Mueller’s investigators that it was FBI officials who revealed to her that Comey reopened the Hillary email case just then because “they felt confident that the New York Field Office would leak it.” And then, if Hillary won as expected, imagine the outcry if it was revealed the FBI had been sitting on the fact that they were still investigating Hillary’s emails—never mind that they had a much more sensitive counterintelligence investigation into Russian contacts with the Trump campaign.In October of this year, after a three-year investigation, the State Department found &quot;no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information&quot; by Hillary Clinton, but stated as James Comey had in 2016 that the use of the private email system had made Clinton more vulnerable to the risk of compromise.* * *JUST THE FACTS, MA’AM* * *James Kallstrom is a big bear of a guy with a warm smile and easy Boston accent. His presence can fill a room. But his facial expression will suddenly turn hard as nails when discussing deeply felt beliefs. Unfortunately, these days, one of those beliefs is that the so-called deep state is out to get his pal, Donald J. Trump. Kallstrom used to be, like the fictional detective Joe Friday on the old TV series Dragnet, looking for “just the facts.” But the hero of the TWA 800 investigation now spends his days spinning conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton, appearing on Fox News programs calling her “corrupt and crazy” and also referring to the former deputy director of his own FBI, Andy McCabe, as “corrupt.” He has even called former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan “communists.” Kallstrom repeatedly disparaged former FBI Director Robert Mueller. Kallstrom also took to the airwaves to defend Trump cronies Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort, bemoaning how badly treated they were by Mueller and the FBI, but that was before they were convicted of felonies.Apparently Kallstrom has a high regard for his former law enforcement and intelligence community colleagues, but only those who are die-hard Trump supporters and Hillary-haters. Otherwise, it doesn’t seem to matter to him what you’ve done at the FBI or for your country, if you have anything bad to say about Trump—you’re scum.If Trump’s Rage Brings ‘Civil War,’ Where Will the Military Stand?Kallstrom’s role politicizing the FBI after 27 years of distinguished service is disgraceful and disappointing. I do not doubt Louis Freeh holds some of the same opinions, especially about the Clintons, but his public appearances have been much more professional in demeanor and nuanced in tone. A former Marine, Kallstrom is founder and chairman of the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation which has given tens of millions of dollars to charities and scholarships. Donald Trump has been a consistent donor and Rush Limbaugh sits on its board of directors. The foundation is an example of the nexus of certain people in the military and law enforcement whose support Donald Trump enjoys. All this is pretty startling if you consider that the heavily Catholic law enforcement officers who are part of Kallstrom’s circle are the very people who should be most aware that for decades Donald Trump was tabloid fodder for humiliating his wives, and for being one of the most corrupt, unethical, con men in New York.And there is this: Kallstrom and Mueller are both highly decorated U.S. Marine veterans. It is unusual, and considered lacking in honor, for one former Marine to question publicly the integrity and motives of another. But these days honor is not part of the agenda. * * *&quot;HE&#39;S GOOD FOR IT&quot;* * *In July 1996, I traveled with a team of FBI agents to the site of the upcoming Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta. The multi-agency tabletop security exercises we were there to observe went well, but the reality on the ground was chaotic. Venues were small and spread out around the greater Atlanta area. Crowds would be large and expected to travel from venue to venue, creating a security nightmare. An overriding concern was providing secure transportation for the athletes themselves. It was too late to start vetting all the bus drivers who would be needed for the job, so the task of shuttling athletes would go to military personnel. Fears of a terrorist attack, even a chemical-biological release, were palpable.Then, on the night of July 27, a pipe bomb went off in Atlanta’s Centennial Olympic Park killing one person and wounding 111 others. A security guard on the scene, Richard Jewell, was brought in to be interviewed by the Atlanta Field Office about what he had observed. Unbeknownst to Jewell, he was the FBI’s leading suspect. The agents strongly believed he fit a certain profile, calling him “a cop wannabe,” a “loser” who probably placed the bomb so he could then position himself as a hero.“He’s good for it,” agents investigating the incident kept repeating. They had their man. The Atlanta agents, headed by Special Agent in Charge Woody Johnson, decided to get too cute by half setting up a ruse to trick Jewell. Instead of interviewing Jewell in a neutral setting, as originally promised, they asked him to come to the Atlanta FBI office with the bogus claim that he would be helping to make a training video. Part of the training video would include Jewell being read his Miranda rights. FBI Director Louis Freeh, who anointed himself the lead case agent for the Olympic bombing, grew uncomfortable with what was happening and instructed his agents in Atlanta to read Jewell his rights for real, and have him acknowledge he understood them. Jewell soon became aware he was a suspect, and that the FBI had been talking to him without a lawyer present. That soon changed, but word got out to the media and all hell broke loose. Richard Jewell’s life became a nightmare.Agents in Atlanta and FBI headquarters were furious with Freeh for micromanaging and screwing up their case against the man they were convinced “was good for it.” It soon became clear, however, that Jewell had actually helped direct people away from the area after receiving an anonymous phone call warning about the bomb, and that his actions had been more heroic than criminal. But it would be three long months before he was cleared by the FBI. Jewell sued several media outlets for publishing his name after it was leaked to them. They would ultimately settle with him for hundreds of thousands of dollars. (Jewell died of a heart attack in 2007 at the age of 44, but his story is the subject of a film directed by Clint Eastwood set to be released this month.) Eric Rudolph, the actual culprit in the Atlanta attack, was an anti-abortion, anti-gay extremist and serial bomber. He was not apprehended until 2003, seven years after Atlanta, and he is currently serving four consecutive life sentences for that bombing and as well as several attacks on clinics where abortions were performed. * * *KENYA AND TANZANIA* * *On Aug. 7, 1998, two American embassies in East Africa were bombed simultaneously, one in Nairobi, Kenya, and the other in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, killing 260 people and injuring thousands more.The attack took place eight years to the day after American troops landed in Saudi Arabia in response to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. The presence of American troops on the holy soil of Saudi Arabia had infuriated Osama bin Laden and was a major factor in his decision to wage jihad against the United States. Again, this was an attack on innocent civilians—most of whom were not Americans. East Africa was an al Qaeda sanctuary that had gone operational. If one looks carefully enough, many of the most publicized terrorist attacks had clear antecedents that had gotten little or no public attention. Most of the group that put together the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993 had been connected to man who murdered the radical Zionist Meir Kahane. The mastermind of the 1993 bombing, however, was Ramzi Yousef, whose uncle Khalid Sheikh Mohammed would go on to plan the 9/11 attacks. The Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia in 1996 followed on the murder of six defense contractors in Riyadh two years earlier. The attacks on U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998 grew out of events in Somalia five years before. had its harbinger five years earlier in Mogadishu, Somalia. The militia group under Somalia war-lord Mohamed Aidid had been thwarting efforts by a U.N. multinational force to get food to the starving Somali population. After Aidid’s group killed 24 Pakistani soldiers, “Operation Restore Hope” became “Operation Gothic Serpent” and U.S. forces entered Mogadishu to apprehend Aidid leaders. The Americans walked into an ambush and the “Battle for Mogadishu” ensued, killing 18 American soldiers as well countless Somalis. (The incident is best known as “Black Hawk Down.”)Within three days, the Clinton administration decided U.S. forces should leave Somalia. This fact wasn’t lost on al Qaeda, which the Intelligence Community later found had veterans of the Afghan jihad in Somalia who had trained Aidid’s forces, especially with the use of the rocket-launched grenades that had been used to take down the Black Hawk. After the attack, Osama bin Laden would say, &quot;When the valiant soldiers of Islam came to them with the rod of Moses and the mujahideen poured their fire on them, the Americans withdrew from Somalia in an unexpected haste.”The Clinton administration’s new secretary of defense, Les Aspin, received most blame for the disaster in Somalia having denied requests for more military hardware. The former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Aspin and the Hill staffers he brought with him to the Pentagon received very poor marks for their inability to get hold of the enormous Pentagon bureaucracy. Working for the Defense Intelligence Agency at the time, I heard Les Aspin’s name cursed in the halls of the Pentagon after Mogadishu. But it was pressure from Congress that forced Clinton to ask Aspin for his resignation. Now, in 1998, two American embassies lay in rubble in two other East African countries.* * *GRAND DELUSION* * *Paradoxically, the attacks in Khobar, Mogadishu, Nairobi, and Dar-es-Salaam reinforced a false sense of security in the U.S. that terrorist operations occurred only “over there” in distant, mostly third world countries. Repeatedly, throughout the 1990s, the heads of the Intelligence Community marched up to Intelligence Committees and told them there were “no credible threats” to the U.S. mainland. And that notion was not challenged until 1999 when Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian citizen living in Montreal, was apprehended trying to enter the U.S. from Canada to bomb Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) as New Year&#39;s Eve announced the end of the old millennium and the beginning of a new one.The 20th century came to a close with the Intelligence Community and law enforcement fully cognizant of, and on edge about, this shadowy organization known as al Qaeda that had cells and followers around the world. Each attack was becoming more audacious and more deadly. Even if the most reliable intelligence had been available, and it was getting better, the most important question still was—what would policymakers decide to do about it? * * *THE COLE* * *On Oct 12, 2000, the USS Cole, an American guided missile destroyer, was attacked in the Port of Aden in Yemen killing 17 sailors. Some 150 armed FBI agents poured into Yemen, a country that was Osama bin Laden’s ancestral home and by 2000, a country already destabilized by civil war was crawling with terrorists in possession of large caches of weapons. U.S. Ambassador Barbara Bodine was operating on a diplomatic track, trying to bond with the Yemeni government. Her diplomatic initiatives were one reason the USS Cole had planned its refueling stop in the Port of Aden in the first place. The FBI agents who arrived, led by John O’Neill, had little patience for the niceties of diplomacy when they knew Yemen was a critical al Qaeda hot spot. Indeed, one of the masterminds of the USS Cole attack eventually would gain entry into the U.S. and became one of the 9/11 hijackers. The fact that Khalid al-Mihdhar was in the U.S. at all was a critical piece of information the CIA failed to provide the FBI in the summer of 2001.After the Thanksgiving holiday of 2000, Ambassador Bodine would deny O’Neill reentry into Yemen. Eventually the situation in the country was deemed so dangerous the FBI agents were pulled out altogether. One can only speculate what might have been uncovered prior to 9/11 had the FBI stayed in country and been allowed to conduct the investigation as it wanted. It is also possible that, having the home-field advantage, al Qaeda could have killed a lot of FBI agents in Yemen.At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing after the USS Cole attack Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey lost his patience. “Why are FBI agents crawling all over Yemen like it’s some crime scene?” he demanded. “This is not a criminal act. This was an act of war!”George W. Bush had just been elected president of the United States, and he did not see things that way. The outgoing Clinton administration had bowed to enormous political pressure after the East African embassy bombings and launched a series of U.S. cruise missile strikes against Sudan, where Bin Laden had based for many years, and Afghanistan, where he had recently relocated under the protection of the Taliban. But the raids Clinton ordered were costly failures, and the new American president, George W. Bush said when it came to dealing with al Qaeda, he was “tired of swatting at flies.&quot;There were so many unknowns in those days. Could the U.S. be officially at war with an organization, as opposed to a country? What would be the FBI’s role? What was Congress’s role? What could the president do as commander in chief? What would be the military’s target? All these issues were raised at closed-door congressional hearings in the summer of 2001. Bin Laden was known to be in Afghanistan. The U.S., through Pakistan, attempted to negotiate with the Taliban to hand him over. They said no. The notion often repeated after 9/11 was that the intelligence community had been “clueless.”I am here to tell you that is wrong. The FBI’s Robert Mueller, CIA’s George Tenet, and NSA Director Michael Hayden—along with their subject-matter experts—appeared before the intelligence committees countless times sounding alarm bells throughout the months leading up to September 2001. “Something’s coming,” George Tenet told anyone who would listen. When pressed, the FBI would say they believed the attack would be overseas. But at the highest levels within the intelligence agencies everyone was on the same page that something was imminent. It was when you went further down the bureaucratic ladder, to the mid-level analysts and agents, that communication broke down. There was a lot of mistrust among the intelligence agencies and within them, and there were reasons.* * *‘WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?’* * *Louis Freeh decided to leave the FBI just three months before 9/11. Had he stayed he would have had to deal with a major humiliation for the nation’s leading law endorsement and counterintelligence agency. A Russian mole—an FBI agent—operated undetected right under Freeh’s nose for 15 years.FBI agent Robert Hanssen, spying for Russia, single-handedly did more damage to U.S. national security than any other traitor in U.S. history. The relationship between the FBI and CIA had gone steadily downhill since the spying investigation into CIA officer Aldrich Ames, convicted of spying for Russia in 1994 . Once identified, the FBI took down Ames flawlessly, but not until it broke a lot of china at the CIA with its heavy-handed style. Then, when Russian intelligence assets continued to be lost, and that loss could no longer be attributed to Ames, both FBI and CIA realized that another mole must exist somewhere. The FBI focused on the CIA, but all the while Hanssen sat in their midst. Just as the CIA had moved a drunken, incompetent Aldrich Ames from one sensitive job to another, the FBI moved the “creepy” and disliked Hanssen from one job to another within the Bureau. Once identified, the FBI again conducted a successful takedown of Hanssen, who asked when apprehended, “What took you so long?”* * *BATMAN* * *I remember entering the Van Ness Metro station in Washington, D.C., early one morning in 2000 on my way into the FBI. There on the platform, sitting on a bench alone, was counterterrorism chief John O’Neill. His reputation among many at the Bureau was as a kind of Dark Knight fighting the good fight, and there he was with the collar of his black coat pulled up around his face. “So, he really is Batman,” I thought. Anyway, that’s what he was, and always will be, to me.Books have been written and movies made about John O’Neill—not only about his aggressive pursuit of al Qaeda but also about the double (or triple) personal life he led. Agents and spooks like to talk about how they are trained in “compartmentalization.” It is what makes them good at their job. All I know, knowing him professionally, was that he kept his personal life strictly outside the office—which is why, when he died, so many were surprised to hear about that part of his life. While there were several well known affairs by high ranking FBI officials going on at the Bureau during the years I worked there (between agents, with secretaries, etc.), I never heard a rumor about John. I never heard him utter a sexist or rude remark. I never heard him bad-mouth a female agent (a frequent occurrence during my time at the Bureau). For a supposed ladies’ man, I never heard a complaint about inappropriate behavior toward a female lodged against John. At work, John was all FBI. He kept agents around him on their toes, knowing they damn well better not come into his office with half-assed information. He loved the agents, and expected the same level of commitment from them, and formed extremely close bonds with several of those he considered among the best.On May 29, 2001, O’Neill was having dinner at Il Vagabondo’s on the Upper East Side of Manhattan with some of us from the Senate Intelligence Committee staff when he got the call a jury in New York had found two men, one Saudi and one Tanzanian, guilty of murder in the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in Nairobi and Tanzania. Two other people, a Jordanian and a Lebanese-born American were also found guilty of conspiracy in the attack.What some there might have suspected was that O’Neill was getting ready to leave the Bureau. What none of us could have known was that he had fewer than four months left to live. As the FBI’s leading terrorist hunter, O’Neill had decided to retire from the FBI in August 2001. He had spent 10 years chasing al Qaeda operatives around the world, but he was continually being passed over for promotions and had been outed to the media, probably by one of his own colleagues, over a security incident. (FBI agents can be petty and vicious toward people they envy and dislike.) The leak to the media about how he had left a briefcase with some classified documents unattended at a conference made O’Neill toxic to the new FBI deputy director, Tom Pickard. So on Monday, Sept. 10, 2001, O’Neill started a lucrative new job as director of security for the New York Port Authority. Its offices were located in the South Tower of the World Trade Center. They found O’Neill’s body 10 days later amid the rubble. Along with another FBI agent, Lenny Hatton, he died helping to direct people out of the buildings when they collapsed. At least 15 FBI agents have since died from cancers attributed to their presence and their work at the scene on Sept. 11, 2001.END PART TWOTOMORROW: THE INQUIRYRead more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Ten minutes into the flight, the plane’s captain reported unusual readings on the Fuel Quantity Indication System (FQIS). Two minutes after that, a catastrophic explosion occurred. TWA 800 broke apart mid-air into three huge sections that came crashing into the sea. People on the South Shore of Long Island would report seeing the fireball in the night. Others reported seeing lights streaking across the sky around the same time as the explosion.Mueller, Barr, Giuliani, Comey and Kallstrom Once Fought Terror Together—Now Trump Has Them Fight Each OtherAlongside the work of the National Transportation Safety Board, the FBI launched an investigation led by the assistant director for the New York field office, James Kallstrom. Until recently, he was defined in history as the man who headed that $20 million, 16-month investigation into the explosion—and who kept conspiracy theories from spinning out of control. And that was no easy task. Pierre Salinger, President John F. Kennedy’s former press secretary, was reporting from France that he had secret information that the plane had been brought down by the friendly fire of a U.S. Navy missile, and that theory has never been completely exorcised from the popular imagination.Despite the fact that all the bodies or fragments of bodies were recovered from the murky ocean depths, and despite the fact that almost all of the airplane had been found and reconstructed in a hangar on Long Island where it underwent hundreds of hours of forensic investigation, suspicions remain to this day concerning the veracity of the final judgment that an explosion in the central fuel tank caused TWA 800 to break apart in mid-air before crashing into the sea.To his credit, Kallstrom personally poured significant emotional energy into dealing with distraught family members. But more recently Kallstrom—who once fought against conspiracy theories—has gone off the rails sacrificing his once sound judgment at the altar of Donald Trump. Enter Rudy Giuliani. The friendship of Kallstrom and Giuliani goes back to the 1970s when Giuliani was a young prosecutor and Kallstrom was a supervisory special agent in the FBI’s New York field office. By the late 1980s, Kallstrom was a well-known surveillance expert who designed the complex bugging operations during the famous New York Pizza Connection investigation and the John Gotti investigation. These were cases worked on by both Giuliani and Louis Freeh, both at the Southern District of New York at the time. Kallstrom was their leading wiretap guy, and the three of them bonded. Later, in the 1990s, when Kallstrom headed the FBI’s New York field office, Giuliani was the city’s mayor. By the mid-1990s the distrust and dislike of Bill and Hillary Clinton that flowed from the FBI leadership down to the rank-and-file was well established. It had been in existence from the minute Bill Clinton won the Democratic nomination to run against the incumbent, President George H.W. Bush. Rumors had begun circulating among federal agents that Hillary was rude and nasty to her Secret Service detail, and that she and her husband hated cops. There were women coming forward accusing Bill Clinton of harassment and rape. Hillary was accused of corruption at her old law firm in Arkansas.When Hillary got ready to run for president in 2016 and was heavily favored to win, the anti-Clinton sentiment had been festering in the Bureau for over two decades, and Giuliani and Kallstrom were well positioned to exploit it. Each man had tentacles still deep inside the Bureau, and as they looked for ways to stop Hillary a sort of cabal developed that included current as well as former FBI agents. * * *ABOUT THOSE EMAILS* * *Hillary Clinton’s detractors in the FBI may have believed they’d finally found the kryptonite needed to put an end to her political career.

But these days honor is not part of the agenda. * * *&quot;HE&#39;S GOOD FOR IT&quot;* * *In July 1996, I traveled with a team of FBI agents to the site of the upcoming Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta. The multi-agency tabletop security exercises we were there to observe went well, but the reality on the ground was chaotic. Venues were small and spread out around the greater Atlanta area. Crowds would be large and expected to travel from venue to venue, creating a security nightmare. An overriding concern was providing secure transportation for the athletes themselves. It was too late to start vetting all the bus drivers who would be needed for the job, so the task of shuttling athletes would go to military personnel. Fears of a terrorist attack, even a chemical-biological release, were palpable.Then, on the night of July 27, a pipe bomb went off in Atlanta’s Centennial Olympic Park killing one person and wounding 111 others. A security guard on the scene, Richard Jewell, was brought in to be interviewed by the Atlanta Field Office about what he had observed. Unbeknownst to Jewell, he was the FBI’s leading suspect. The agents strongly believed he fit a certain profile, calling him “a cop wannabe,” a “loser” who probably placed the bomb so he could then position himself as a hero.“He’s good for it,” agents investigating the incident kept repeating. They had their man. The Atlanta agents, headed by Special Agent in Charge Woody Johnson, decided to get too cute by half setting up a ruse to trick Jewell. Instead of interviewing Jewell in a neutral setting, as originally promised, they asked him to come to the Atlanta FBI office with the bogus claim that he would be helping to make a training video. Part of the training video would include Jewell being read his Miranda rights. FBI Director Louis Freeh, who anointed himself the lead case agent for the Olympic bombing, grew uncomfortable with what was happening and instructed his agents in Atlanta to read Jewell his rights for real, and have him acknowledge he understood them. Jewell soon became aware he was a suspect, and that the FBI had been talking to him without a lawyer present. That soon changed, but word got out to the media and all hell broke loose. Richard Jewell’s life became a nightmare.Agents in Atlanta and FBI headquarters were furious with Freeh for micromanaging and screwing up their case against the man they were convinced “was good for it.” It soon became clear, however, that Jewell had actually helped direct people away from the area after receiving an anonymous phone call warning about the bomb, and that his actions had been more heroic than criminal. But it would be three long months before he was cleared by the FBI. Jewell sued several media outlets for publishing his name after it was leaked to them. They would ultimately settle with him for hundreds of thousands of dollars. (Jewell died of a heart attack in 2007 at the age of 44, but his story is the subject of a film directed by Clint Eastwood set to be released this month.) Eric Rudolph, the actual culprit in the Atlanta attack, was an anti-abortion, anti-gay extremist and serial bomber. He was not apprehended until 2003, seven years after Atlanta, and he is currently serving four consecutive life sentences for that bombing and as well as several attacks on clinics where abortions were performed. * * *KENYA AND TANZANIA* * *On Aug. 7, 1998, two American embassies in East Africa were bombed simultaneously, one in Nairobi, Kenya, and the other in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, killing 260 people and injuring thousands more.The attack took place eight years to the day after American troops landed in Saudi Arabia in response to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. The presence of American troops on the holy soil of Saudi Arabia had infuriated Osama bin Laden and was a major factor in his decision to wage jihad against the United States. Again, this was an attack on innocent civilians—most of whom were not Americans. East Africa was an al Qaeda sanctuary that had gone operational. If one looks carefully enough, many of the most publicized terrorist attacks had clear antecedents that had gotten little or no public attention. Most of the group that put together the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993 had been connected to man who murdered the radical Zionist Meir Kahane. The mastermind of the 1993 bombing, however, was Ramzi Yousef, whose uncle Khalid Sheikh Mohammed would go on to plan the 9/11 attacks. The Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia in 1996 followed on the murder of six defense contractors in Riyadh two years earlier. The attacks on U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998 grew out of events in Somalia five years before. had its harbinger five years earlier in Mogadishu, Somalia. The militia group under Somalia war-lord Mohamed Aidid had been thwarting efforts by a U.N. multinational force to get food to the starving Somali population. After Aidid’s group killed 24 Pakistani soldiers, “Operation Restore Hope” became “Operation Gothic Serpent” and U.S. forces entered Mogadishu to apprehend Aidid leaders. The Americans walked into an ambush and the “Battle for Mogadishu” ensued, killing 18 American soldiers as well countless Somalis. (The incident is best known as “Black Hawk Down.”)Within three days, the Clinton administration decided U.S. forces should leave Somalia. This fact wasn’t lost on al Qaeda, which the Intelligence Community later found had veterans of the Afghan jihad in Somalia who had trained Aidid’s forces, especially with the use of the rocket-launched grenades that had been used to take down the Black Hawk. After the attack, Osama bin Laden would say, &quot;When the valiant soldiers of Islam came to them with the rod of Moses and the mujahideen poured their fire on them, the Americans withdrew from Somalia in an unexpected haste.”The Clinton administration’s new secretary of defense, Les Aspin, received most blame for the disaster in Somalia having denied requests for more military hardware. The former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Aspin and the Hill staffers he brought with him to the Pentagon received very poor marks for their inability to get hold of the enormous Pentagon bureaucracy. Working for the Defense Intelligence Agency at the time, I heard Les Aspin’s name cursed in the halls of the Pentagon after Mogadishu. But it was pressure from Congress that forced Clinton to ask Aspin for his resignation. Now, in 1998, two American embassies lay in rubble in two other East African countries.* * *GRAND DELUSION* * *Paradoxically, the attacks in Khobar, Mogadishu, Nairobi, and Dar-es-Salaam reinforced a false sense of security in the U.S. that terrorist operations occurred only “over there” in distant, mostly third world countries. Repeatedly, throughout the 1990s, the heads of the Intelligence Community marched up to Intelligence Committees and told them there were “no credible threats” to the U.S. mainland. And that notion was not challenged until 1999 when Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian citizen living in Montreal, was apprehended trying to enter the U.S. from Canada to bomb Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) as New Year&#39;s Eve announced the end of the old millennium and the beginning of a new one.The 20th century came to a close with the Intelligence Community and law enforcement fully cognizant of, and on edge about, this shadowy organization known as al Qaeda that had cells and followers around the world. Each attack was becoming more audacious and more deadly. Even if the most reliable intelligence had been available, and it was getting better, the most important question still was—what would policymakers decide to do about it? * * *THE COLE* * *On Oct 12, 2000, the USS Cole, an American guided missile destroyer, was attacked in the Port of Aden in Yemen killing 17 sailors. Some 150 armed FBI agents poured into Yemen, a country that was Osama bin Laden’s ancestral home and by 2000, a country already destabilized by civil war was crawling with terrorists in possession of large caches of weapons. U.S. Ambassador Barbara Bodine was operating on a diplomatic track, trying to bond with the Yemeni government. Her diplomatic initiatives were one reason the USS Cole had planned its refueling stop in the Port of Aden in the first place. The FBI agents who arrived, led by John O’Neill, had little patience for the niceties of diplomacy when they knew Yemen was a critical al Qaeda hot spot. Indeed, one of the masterminds of the USS Cole attack eventually would gain entry into the U.S. and became one of the 9/11 hijackers. The fact that Khalid al-Mihdhar was in the U.S. at all was a critical piece of information the CIA failed to provide the FBI in the summer of 2001.After the Thanksgiving holiday of 2000, Ambassador Bodine would deny O’Neill reentry into Yemen. Eventually the situation in the country was deemed so dangerous the FBI agents were pulled out altogether. One can only speculate what might have been uncovered prior to 9/11 had the FBI stayed in country and been allowed to conduct the investigation as it wanted. It is also possible that, having the home-field advantage, al Qaeda could have killed a lot of FBI agents in Yemen.At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing after the USS Cole attack Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey lost his patience. “Why are FBI agents crawling all over Yemen like it’s some crime scene?” he demanded. “This is not a criminal act. This was an act of war!”George W. Bush had just been elected president of the United States, and he did not see things that way. The outgoing Clinton administration had bowed to enormous political pressure after the East African embassy bombings and launched a series of U.S. cruise missile strikes against Sudan, where Bin Laden had based for many years, and Afghanistan, where he had recently relocated under the protection of the Taliban. But the raids Clinton ordered were costly failures, and the new American president, George W. Bush said when it came to dealing with al Qaeda, he was “tired of swatting at flies.&quot;There were so many unknowns in those days. Could the U.S. be officially at war with an organization, as opposed to a country? What would be the FBI’s role? What was Congress’s role? What could the president do as commander in chief? What would be the military’s target? All these issues were raised at closed-door congressional hearings in the summer of 2001. Bin Laden was known to be in Afghanistan. The U.S., through Pakistan, attempted to negotiate with the Taliban to hand him over. They said no. The notion often repeated after 9/11 was that the intelligence community had been “clueless.”I am here to tell you that is wrong. The FBI’s Robert Mueller, CIA’s George Tenet, and NSA Director Michael Hayden—along with their subject-matter experts—appeared before the intelligence committees countless times sounding alarm bells throughout the months leading up to September 2001. “Something’s coming,” George Tenet told anyone who would listen. When pressed, the FBI would say they believed the attack would be overseas. But at the highest levels within the intelligence agencies everyone was on the same page that something was imminent. It was when you went further down the bureaucratic ladder, to the mid-level analysts and agents, that communication broke down. There was a lot of mistrust among the intelligence agencies and within them, and there were reasons.* * *‘WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?’* * *Louis Freeh decided to leave the FBI just three months before 9/11. Had he stayed he would have had to deal with a major humiliation for the nation’s leading law endorsement and counterintelligence agency. A Russian mole—an FBI agent—operated undetected right under Freeh’s nose for 15 years.FBI agent Robert Hanssen, spying for Russia, single-handedly did more damage to U.S. national security than any other traitor in U.S. history. The relationship between the FBI and CIA had gone steadily downhill since the spying investigation into CIA officer Aldrich Ames, convicted of spying for Russia in 1994 . Once identified, the FBI took down Ames flawlessly, but not until it broke a lot of china at the CIA with its heavy-handed style. Then, when Russian intelligence assets continued to be lost, and that loss could no longer be attributed to Ames, both FBI and CIA realized that another mole must exist somewhere. The FBI focused on the CIA, but all the while Hanssen sat in their midst. Just as the CIA had moved a drunken, incompetent Aldrich Ames from one sensitive job to another, the FBI moved the “creepy” and disliked Hanssen from one job to another within the Bureau. Once identified, the FBI again conducted a successful takedown of Hanssen, who asked when apprehended, “What took you so long?”* * *BATMAN* * *I remember entering the Van Ness Metro station in Washington, D.C., early one morning in 2000 on my way into the FBI. There on the platform, sitting on a bench alone, was counterterrorism chief John O’Neill. His reputation among many at the Bureau was as a kind of Dark Knight fighting the good fight, and there he was with the collar of his black coat pulled up around his face. “So, he really is Batman,” I thought. Anyway, that’s what he was, and always will be, to me.Books have been written and movies made about John O’Neill—not only about his aggressive pursuit of al Qaeda but also about the double (or triple) personal life he led. Agents and spooks like to talk about how they are trained in “compartmentalization.” It is what makes them good at their job. All I know, knowing him professionally, was that he kept his personal life strictly outside the office—which is why, when he died, so many were surprised to hear about that part of his life. While there were several well known affairs by high ranking FBI officials going on at the Bureau during the years I worked there (between agents, with secretaries, etc.), I never heard a rumor about John. I never heard him utter a sexist or rude remark. I never heard him bad-mouth a female agent (a frequent occurrence during my time at the Bureau). For a supposed ladies’ man, I never heard a complaint about inappropriate behavior toward a female lodged against John. At work, John was all FBI. He kept agents around him on their toes, knowing they damn well better not come into his office with half-assed information. He loved the agents, and expected the same level of commitment from them, and formed extremely close bonds with several of those he considered among the best.On May 29, 2001, O’Neill was having dinner at Il Vagabondo’s on the Upper East Side of Manhattan with some of us from the Senate Intelligence Committee staff when he got the call a jury in New York had found two men, one Saudi and one Tanzanian, guilty of murder in the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in Nairobi and Tanzania. Two other people, a Jordanian and a Lebanese-born American were also found guilty of conspiracy in the attack.What some there might have suspected was that O’Neill was getting ready to leave the Bureau. What none of us could have known was that he had fewer than four months left to live. As the FBI’s leading terrorist hunter, O’Neill had decided to retire from the FBI in August 2001. He had spent 10 years chasing al Qaeda operatives around the world, but he was continually being passed over for promotions and had been outed to the media, probably by one of his own colleagues, over a security incident. (FBI agents can be petty and vicious toward people they envy and dislike.) The leak to the media about how he had left a briefcase with some classified documents unattended at a conference made O’Neill toxic to the new FBI deputy director, Tom Pickard. So on Monday, Sept. 10, 2001, O’Neill started a lucrative new job as director of security for the New York Port Authority. Its offices were located in the South Tower of the World Trade Center. They found O’Neill’s body 10 days later amid the rubble. Along with another FBI agent, Lenny Hatton, he died helping to direct people out of the buildings when they collapsed. At least 15 FBI agents have since died from cancers attributed to their presence and their work at the scene on Sept. 11, 2001.END PART TWOTOMORROW: THE INQUIRYRead more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

The ambition at COP25 is to build on the four-year-old Paris Agreement, at which governments pledged to limit fossil-fuel pollution, by reviving a corner of the market in carbon pollution credits. If that doesn’t sound like stakes commensurate with the ongoing climate crisis, that’s because it isn’t.Protesters have taken to the streets again and again this year calling for immediate action to cut back on fossil fuels, including thousands of arrests in more than a dozen cities in October alone. The 16-year-old activist Greta Thunburg harangued world leaders for their inaction at the prior UN climate summit. The politics of the masses and the politics of the diplomats have rarely been so mismatched as they are at these Madrid climate talks.“There is a disconnect between what people are asking for and what we’re seeing,” Gilles Dufranse, policy officer at Carbon Market Watch, a Brussels-based research group that advises companies on how to put a price on greenhouse-gas emissions. “Multilateral meetings are very difficult, but it’s the only solution we have.”And billions of dollars could be in play, which is why thousands of companies and hundreds of financial institutions will be watching COP25 closely. Away from the headlines and grand promises sought by environmental groups, the delegates are quietly building a legal framework to support a wall of money that will guide the world in a greener direction.Scientific findings this year have given an urgency to the process. Carbon emissions and temperatures have been breaking records, which scientists have linked to the increased frequency of violent storms and wildfires everywhere from Sweden to Japan and California. Global temperature increases since the industrial revolution are on track to push well past the UN target of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), according to research from Climate Action Tracker, a group of three consultants examining the issue. While few would notice that amount of warming on a single day, when applied to the world as a whole it would mark the quickest shift in the climate since the end of the last ice age some 10,000 years ago.Shifting the world away from fossil fuels will require mind-boggling amounts of money. At least $71 trillion needs to be invested into energy over the next 20 years to reach the nirvana where global warming is held in check and the UN meets its sustainable development goals, according to the International Energy Agency. That’s about a fifth more than the $59 trillion that the IEA figures will be spent under a business-as-usual scenario.Raising that amount of cash requires slow and careful work. Like arms control or trade negotiations, the climate talks deliver milestone treaties only after years of preparation, spending the time in between on fine details undergirding broad arrangements already put in place. The carbon market is one of the most complicated mechanisms envoys have worked on, since it touches so many parts of the economy.The aim is to set up a system that creates credits for work done to reduce emissions. That might include installing wind farms, protecting forests or insulating buildings so they consume less energy. Countries that generate more savings than their target would be able to sell those credits to others that are struggling to reach their goal.In theory, that will channel money to projects where the biggest savings can be made most cheaply. The difficulty is in defining what kinds of work count, how to measure those savings and what would ensure that countries don’t get credit both for making the savings and generating a credit. And this year, the envoys will talk about how to add the UN sustainable development goals to the market mechanism, adding issues like poverty and water protection to the list of things that might be able to generate a credit.The Long Road to MadridThe meeting in Madrid is part of a series of discussions stretching back three decades. It will bring together energy and environment ministers from the 197 countries that signed the Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992. About 20,000 people will attend, including press, pressure groups and multinational institutions ranging from OPEC to the World Bank.The 1992 treaty held that global warming was real, rich industrial nations caused it and should therefore help developing countries with aid and technology to support greener solutions. While each one of those ideas is controversial now in Washington, the U.S. ratified the treaty under Republican President George H.W. Bush. President Donald Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Agreement but not the convention that made the 1992 treaty possible.The convention led to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which was a landmark because it mandated emissions cuts in 37 industrial nations plus the European Union. That group vowed to cut fossil fuel pollution 5% from 1990 levels by 2012, and later signed up to a second commitment period that will finish next year, when the Paris Agreement kicks in.Paris marked the first time that all countries, rich and poor alike, agreed to make cuts in their greenhouse gas emissions. That brought China and India into the system. They had no obligations under Kyoto but since then have become two of the worst polluters. The cost of bringing those countries on board was that the Paris commitments are voluntary — every country decides for itself what level of emissions cut it can make and how those will be achieved.On the Agenda This YearThis year’s meeting in Madrid is meant to elaborate on Article 6 of the 27-page Paris Agreement. That section deals with creating market mechanisms that each nation can use to help it meet emissions targets—something companies think they can profit from.These systems aren’t new. The Clean Development Mechanism came out of Kyoto and has fed at least $138 billion into projects that reduce harmful gases that come from burning fossil fuels. The ambition in Madrid is to create a “Sustainable Development Mechanism” that might go well beyond the work of the CDM, feeding money both to clean-energy programs and to projects that meet the 17 UN sustainable development goals.Friction over the nature of the rules is threatening this work and prevented a deal on Article 6 last year. Industrial nations led by the European Union want careful record-keeping and verification to make sure aid money actually goes into cutting emissions, which was one of the things the CDM lacked. Developing nations led by Brazil want a more flexible and free-wheeling system where a wider variety of programs qualify. An agreement is crucial to get big money to back the new Sustainable Development Mechanism credits.“What is critical is the credibility of the system,” said Gianpiero Nacci, deputy head of climate finance at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a London-based institution that’s helping commercial banks unlock money for green finance. “It could accelerate low-carbon investment.”About 2 billion CDM credits each representing 1 ton of avoided emissions were issued over the life of the program. The value of those credits peaked at more than 21 euros ($23) in 2008. They tumbled since and trade at around 17 cents apiece now after the EU, which was the main buyer of the credits, lost faith in CDM bookkeeping and wanted to clear up a glut in its own Emissions Trading System.The CDM’s demise still rankles developing nations, which are anxious to see the cash infusion they’ve been promised. A decade ago, industrial countries pledged to step up climate-related aid to $100 billion a year by 2020. While they’re on the way to reaching that goal, dishing out $71.2 billion in 2017 according to the OECD, there’s little detail on how that money will flow in the future.That puts attention on the Article 6 debate. Creating rules around a Sustainable Development Mechanism would also set out a framework for clean-energy developers financiers to work with and unlock money for more emissions-cutting work. Slowly, the financial world is taking note. More than 500 fund managers with $35 trillion of assets calling on governments to take more action through a London-based group called the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change.“Business people want clarity,” said Jean-Marc Ollagnier, chief executive of Accenture Plc’s resources operating group. “When they get clarity they will find incentives to invest.

Donald Trump and his allies see it clearly. Democrats must now step up and confront reality, or risk losing ground for good.’ Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesThere are few phrases as fundamental to US politics as foreign policy. It shapes the balance of power between branches of government. It separates a special class of public servants. And it commands sober respect from both sides of the partisan aisle.Indeed, in American politics, “foreign policy” is a phrase used so unthinkingly that it may be strange to point out what it really is: a paradigm first developed to protect the English monarchy, imported across the Atlantic by our nation’s founders, stretched to breaking point by over two centuries of geopolitical change, and broken – at last – by the presidency of Donald Trump.embedAccording to the old paradigm of foreign policy, there is a clear line between domestic and foreign: inside our borders, we may fight about taxes, transfers, and fundamental rights; but once we venture outside those borders, it is our “national interest” against the world. In the immortal words of Senator Arthur Vandenberg: “Politics stops at the water’s edge.”The concept of “foreign policy” emerged in eighteenth-century England as a strategy to insulate the Crown’s authority abroad from parliamentary pressure at home. “We ought not to pry into such secrets as relate to foreign Affairs,” implored Sir William Yonge of his fellow Members of Parliament in 1743. “As our business relates chiefly to domestick affairs, we ought to keep within that province.” But in the US, foreign policy – and its notion of a national interest protected by the executive – became a cherished ideal behind which the founders promised to lead their city on the hill.Trump has laid waste to this worldview. From welcoming Russian electoral interference in the US to seeking dirt on rivals in relations with China and Ukraine, Trump has eschewed the traditional rules of foreign policy to practice a novel form of foreign politics: a framework of international affairs with little regard for Vandenberg’s cardinal rule.To the horror of the beltway establishment, he leaves half the state department empty and elevates transactional horse-trading above institutional protocol. Rather than relying on career diplomats and respecting old alliances, he takes to Twitter and courts useful dictators. Rather than pretending to represent the national interest, he openly advocates for a narrow swath of supporters and cronies.This is a paradigm shift long in formation. Over the course of the last two centuries, the Westphalian system that inspired the founding architects of US foreign policy – a world of sovereign nation-states communicating through their respective executives – has broken down, displaced by a new set of transnational networks often dominated by non-state actors: Facebooks and Googles, Blackrocks and Deutsche Banks.&gt; Trump has eschewed the traditional rules of foreign policy to practice a novel form of foreign politicsIn this new global context, the boundaries between foreign and domestic have blurred. China, for example, owns more US debt, trades more with the US, and emits more greenhouse gases than any other country. Unlike with past adversaries, the interests of countless American businesses cannot be disentangled from Chinese economic success.The notion of a single “national interest”, for its part, has degraded to mere farce. After five decades of stagnant wages and inflamed wealth inequality, few believe that the boats still rise together. When the US government protects the intellectual property of its pharmaceutical companies – raising prices for American patients while guaranteeing offshore profits – whose interest does it really serve?Trump’s election was a symptom of a foreign policy paradigm in terminal decline; his foreign politics a dark premonition of what might replace it. Not only were his supporters reacting to a general sense that they had lost control over their national borders in the process of rapid international integration; they were also reacting to a more acute sense that the US government and its army of diplomats merely channeled the interests of a transnational economic elite. Trump promised to attack that elite, and – through his diplomacy-by-Twitter – cut out the middlemen unworthy of trust.Trump is, of course, not alone. From Benjamin Netanyahu to Vladimir Putin, rightwing leaders are practicing foreign politics to advance their personal interests, linking up in a network of like-minded authoritarians who have little respect for the cherished norms of the liberal international order.Where does that leave the Democratic party and its presidential contenders?Broadly divided into three camps: the Restorers, the Restrainers, and the Transformers. Each takes a different view of foreign policy, though none faces up to the paradigm shift at hand.Restorers like Joe Biden view Donald Trump as the great aberration who pushed US foreign policy off its stable path; their policies aim, therefore, to reset the clock: rejoin the Paris accords, re-sign the Iran deal. This is a platform of nostalgic denial: Restorers neither appreciate the fragility of Obama’s foreign policy victories, nor recognize his many failings.&gt; The rules of the global game have changed for good. Trump and his allies see it clearlyRestrainers, by contrast, reckon with the failings of foreign policy past – in particular, a string of broken promises with respect to America’s armed intervention abroad. Their core commitment is to “end the endless war”, drastically downsizing the US military and demanding greater oversight of its operations. In other words, their aim is not necessarily to replace the old foreign policy toolkit wholesale, but to catch the arm of the US government as it reaches for its most lethal tool.In this sense, the Restrainers ultimately defend the foreign policy paradigm, appealing to the more noble traditions of American diplomacy. But by calling for a more “responsible” form of statecraft, the Restrainers betray their own nostalgia for the calm waters of the liberal international order. The principle of restraint is certainly an important virtue in international affairs. But it is a brittle one: it implies that the US is holding back from serving its true interests, and is therefore vulnerable to strongmen who vow to break taboos and serve them better.This is where the Transformers should come in. Represented in the presidential race by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the Transformers recognize the profound shift in international affairs and the range of new methods that will be necessary as a result.Sanders speaks, for example, of the need for an “international progressive front” that supports “partnerships not just between governments, but between peoples”. Elizabeth Warren describes a similar seismic shift in our foreign affairs. “The world was changing before President Trump took office, and it will continue to change after he has gone,” Elizabeth Warren wrote in her pitch for a “Foreign Policy for All”.But the Transformers, too, have offered little to move us beyond the old paradigm. Sanders provides few concrete plans to build a progressive front or international institutions to facilitate people-to-people partnerships. And Warren’s vision remains faithful to its core myth of a unified national interest. Her “foreign policy for all” is a contradiction in terms: protecting some American interests on the global stage will require undermining others.Here, we can start to see the outline a different kind of a foreign politics: a progressive foreign politics, which begins from the same premise as Trump – that politics no longer stops at the water’s edge – but inverts its strategies, policies and priorities. One that builds new multilateral institutions, rather than wrecking them; one that powers democratic movements, rather than squashing them; one that is unafraid to champion the shared interests of a global 99% against those of a consolidated transnational oligarchy.The rules of the global game have changed for good. Trump and his allies see it clearly. Democrats must now step up and confront their new reality. Politics no longer end at the water’s edge. But from watching these debates, Democrats seem like the last to know.  * David Adler is Policy Leader Fellow at the School of Transnational Governance at the European University Institute.  * Ben Judah is a fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington DC","description":"Progressives need a new doctrine, championing the interests of the global 99% against a transnational oligarchy  ‘The rules of the global game have changed for good.

Train companies plan to raise prices by an average 2.7% next year.Corbyn: Terrorists Should Be Released If Rehabilitated (Earlier)Last Friday’s terrorist attack is dominating campaigning ahead of the Dec. 12 election. At an event to launch his Labour Party’s pledge to cut regulated rail fares by 33% from January, leader Jeremy Corbyn was again quizzed about prisons and sentencing amid a deepening row with Boris Johnson’s Tories.“Terrorists should be sentenced, as they are, and they should be released as and when they have completed a significant proportion of their sentence and they’ve undergone rehabilitation and they are considered safe to the public as a whole,” Corbyn said, according to the Press Association.The row comes after Johnson pledged to end a 2008 law brought in under the last Labour government that gives prisoners automatic early release. Corbyn responded by blaming a decade of cuts to the prison service under the Conservatives for weakening its ability to detect risk and rehabilitate inmates.Johnson Using Trump Playbook on Security: Lee (Earlier)Former Conservative justice minister Phillip Lee, who defected to the Liberal Democrats this year in protest at the government’s Brexit strategy, accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of channeling the Trumpian playbook in the wake of the London Bridge terrorist attack last week.“He’s just pressing buttons. We know this is the Trump playbook,” Lee said, referring to Johnson’s pledge to toughen sentencing. “The practical reality is it’s extremely difficult to do that if you haven’t got the prison places. And we never really had enough prison places in all the time I was a justice minister.”Lee’s comments on Sky News illustrate the risk for Johnson as he seeks to blame policies under the last Labour government -- which was voted out in 2010 -- for the circumstances surrounding last week’s attack. The premier has been framing his Tories as the party of law and order, but that means having to distance himself from justice system cuts made by his Tory predecessors.“We knew there was a problem with the probation service, which had been privatized in 2012 under Chris Grayling,” said Lee, who became justice minister in 2016. “It’s a cycle -- from police, courts, probation. They’ve all got to be working well if you want to reduce crime, reduce pressure on prisons, and be able to lock up the people like Usman Khan for much longer, indeed forever,” he said, referring to the convicted terrorist who carried out Friday’s attack.U.K. to Investigate Terrorists on Early Release (Earlier)Government officials are looking at all 70-odd cases of individuals convicted of terrorism who have been released on license, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told BBC radio on Monday.“We are satisfying ourselves about the details and making sure that first of all, any license conditions are being complied with,” Buckland said. “If not, then individuals can be and will be recalled to prison, and secondly making sure that any license conditions are as comprehensive as possible.”Officials have decided that none will be allowed at events like the one attended by the perpetrator of Friday’s attack, he said. They’ll also examine early release programs and said it’s “right” to look again at the sentencing of terrorists and put public protection at the center of a future regime.Terrorists “can in effect hoodwink trained professionals,” Buckland said. He added that politicians need to “pause, and get the tone of this debate right.”Earlier:Johnson Bolsters Security Message After London Knife AttackJohnson and Corbyn Play Blame Game After U.K. Terrorist AttackTories Focus on Security Before NATO Summit: U.K. Campaign TrailTo contact the reporter on this story: Alex Morales in London at amorales2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Stuart Biggs, Mark WilliamsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","description":"(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson is seeking to present his Conservatives as the party of security amid a bitter row with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour over the circumstances that led to last week’s terrorist attack.

We know this is the Trump playbook,” Lee said, referring to Johnson’s pledge to toughen sentencing. “The practical reality is it’s extremely difficult to do that if you haven’t got the prison places. And we never really had enough prison places in all the time I was a justice minister.”Lee’s comments on Sky News illustrate the risk for Johnson as he seeks to blame policies under the last Labour government -- which was voted out in 2010 -- for the circumstances surrounding last week’s attack. The premier has been framing his Tories as the party of law and order, but that means having to distance himself from justice system cuts made by his Tory predecessors.“We knew there was a problem with the probation service, which had been privatized in 2012 under Chris Grayling,” said Lee, who became justice minister in 2016. “It’s a cycle -- from police, courts, probation. They’ve all got to be working well if you want to reduce crime, reduce pressure on prisons, and be able to lock up the people like Usman Khan for much longer, indeed forever,” he said, referring to the convicted terrorist who carried out Friday’s attack.U.K. to Investigate Terrorists on Early Release (Earlier)Government officials are looking at all 70-odd cases of individuals convicted of terrorism who have been released on license, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told BBC radio on Monday.“We are satisfying ourselves about the details and making sure that first of all, any license conditions are being complied with,” Buckland said. “If not, then individuals can be and will be recalled to prison, and secondly making sure that any license conditions are as comprehensive as possible.”Officials have decided that none will be allowed at events like the one attended by the perpetrator of Friday’s attack, he said. They’ll also examine early release programs and said it’s “right” to look again at the sentencing of terrorists and put public protection at the center of a future regime.Terrorists “can in effect hoodwink trained professionals,” Buckland said. He added that politicians need to “pause, and get the tone of this debate right.”Earlier:Johnson Bolsters Security Message After London Knife AttackJohnson and Corbyn Play Blame Game After U.K. Terrorist AttackTories Focus on Security Before NATO Summit: U.K. Campaign TrailTo contact the reporter on this story: Alex Morales in London at amorales2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Stuart Biggs, Mark WilliamsFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https://news.yahoo.com/u-k-conservatives-labour-fight-111450915.html","date":"2019-12-02T11:14:50.000Z","id":1768},"1769":{"title":"Woman reveals her fiancé was 'mad' at her for choosing a wedding ring that makes him 'look cheap'","summary":"Olga Vilkova, who is from Russia but lives in North Carolina in the US, revealed how her own fiancé is 'mad' at her for picking out a wedding ring that makes him look 'cheap.'","description":"Olga Vilkova, who is from Russia but lives in North Carolina in the US, revealed how her own fiancé is 'mad' at her for picking out a wedding ring that makes him look 'cheap.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7746341/Woman-reveals-fianc-mad-choosing-wedding-ring-makes-look-cheap.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","date":"2019-12-02T11:43:52.000Z","id":1769},"1770":{"title":"Sir Paul McCartney wins permission to prune protected trees in the garden of his £10 million home","summary":"Westminster Council initially said the plans to cut back trees in the garden of the west London home were too vague.

Trump will meet separately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who announced last week that NATO members had agreed to lower America&#39;s contribution to NATO&#39;s $2.5 billion annual budget to 16 percent from 22 percent. Several countries have agreed to increase their military spending. The summit comes as Trump faces an ongoing impeachment inquiry at home, and calls from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for Trump avoid commenting on a looming U.K. election intended to break a stalemate over Brexit. [Reuters, USA Today] 3.The death toll from weekend gun battles between Mexican security forces and drug-cartel gunmen rose to at least 20 on Sunday, when government agents killed seven cartel members, Mexican authorities said. The violence began Saturday when dozens of armed cartel associates attacked a town hall in northern Mexico. It was the latest in a series of troubling signs about the state of security in the country. The attack came on the eve of the President Andrés Manuel López Obrador&#39;s first anniversary in office. López Obrador, a leftist leader who is popular except for his failure to reduce violence, is under pressure from President Trump to get tougher on the cartels. Trump wants to brand Mexican cartels as terrorist groups, but the Mexican leader said he would not return to a &quot;war on drugs&quot; run by the military, calling it an &quot;absurd and deranged strategy.&quot; [New York Post, The Washington Post] 4.Iraqi lawmakers on Sunday approved the resignation of embattled Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi following two months of pro-reform protests that have left more than 430 demonstrators dead. Parliament now heads into a showdown over who will lead the country next. Demonstrators are demanding a new election law and a halt to a power-sharing arrangement dividing control of the government among powerful political groups. Iraqis also are fed up with high unemployment, poor government services, and corruption. The grassroots movement represents the most serious internal challenge to the government since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein. [The Washington Post] 5.U.S. retailers are offering big discounts on Cyber Monday, hoping to outpace record Black Friday online sales of $7.4 billion. The Black Friday record marked the second biggest online shopping day ever seen in the U.S., second only to last year&#39;s Cyber Monday mark of $7.9 billion, according to Adobe Analytics data. Online sales have increased by 20 percent over the same period in last year&#39;s kick-off of the holiday shopping season. Shoppers also spent $4.2 billion online on Thanksgiving, another record. Adobe expected this year&#39;s Cyber Monday to set another record, with sales climbing 18.9 percent over last year to reach $9.4 billion. [CNBC] 6.Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat announced his resignation on Sunday under pressure over a 2017 car bombing that killed anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Muscat said he would step down as leader of the governing Labor Party on Jan. 12, and &quot;in the days after I will resign as prime minister.&quot; Hours before the announcement, nearly 20,000 people protested in the capital, Valletta, demanding his departure. The slain reporter&#39;s family said Muscat&#39;s resignation wouldn&#39;t satisfy a population demanding an end to corruption. &quot;People will be out in the streets again tomorrow,&quot; tweeted one of her sons, Matthew Caruana Galizia, also a journalist. Maltese businessman Yorgen Fenech was arraigned Saturday on charges of complicity in the killing. Muscat&#39;s former Chief of Staff Keith Schembri and Fenech are old friends. [The Associated Press, The New York Times] 7.Former Rep. Joe Sestak, a retired three-star admiral, ended his longshot campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on Sunday. &quot;Without the privilege of national press, it is unfair to ask others to husband their resolve and to sacrifice resources any longer,&quot; Sestak tweeted. Sestak announced his candidacy in June, but never mustered enough support to make it onto the stage in any of the party&#39;s debates. He never got above 1 percent in the polls. His policy positions were in sync with those of the other moderates in the crowded Democratic field, but he had counted on his military leadership experience to help him stand out. [CNBC] 8.Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, whose text messages with colleague Peter Strzok have drawn frequent criticism from President Trump, broke two years of silence in an interview published Sunday by The Daily Beast. &quot;I&#39;m done being quiet,&quot; Page said. Page left the FBI 18 months ago, about six months after The Washington Post first reported that the Justice Department inspector general was investigating her, and that she and Strzok, an FBI investigator, had an affair. Page said the Trump administration &quot;cherry-picked&quot; text messages she and Strzok exchanged belittling Trump to suggest that there was a deep-state conspiracy. Trump has accused her of treason. Page called the attacks &quot;very intimidating,&quot; but said, &quot;I know there&#39;s no fathomable way that I have committed any crime at all, let alone treason.&quot; [The Daily Beast] 9.A deadly winter storm is hitting the Northeast with snow and ice on Monday, forcing airlines to cancel hundreds of flights as the last travelers return from Thanksgiving trips. The storm disrupted holiday travel for days after hitting the West Coast as a powerful &quot;bomb cyclone&quot; and pushing through the Plains and the Midwest. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo told non-essential employees to stay home, with sleet, snow, and rain forecast through the day. State police had already responded to more than 550 storm-related crashes across the state by 7 p.m. Sunday. Icy roads also were blamed for crashes in Pennsylvania. At least six storm-related deaths were reported in recent days in Arizona, Missouri, and South Dakota. [The Associated Press] 10.Disney&#39;s Frozen 2 dominated the domestic box office for the second straight week, with $85.2 million in ticket sales over the weekend. The animated blockbuster also brought in a record $123.7 million over the full five-day Thanksgiving holiday period, smashing a mark of $109 million set by 2013&#39;s The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Frozen 2 now has a North America total of $278 million. Its $130 million debut set a record for Disney Animation. The fantasy film raked in another $164 million overseas to bring its international total to $451 million. Its global total now stands at $739 million, positioning it to soon become the sixth Disney movie in 2019 to make more than $1 billion. The whodunit Knives Out took the No. 2 spot in North America with weekend ticket sales of $27 million.

Trump will meet separately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who announced last week that NATO members had agreed to lower America&#39;s contribution to NATO&#39;s $2.5 billion annual budget to 16 percent from 22 percent. Several countries have agreed to increase their military spending. The summit comes as Trump faces an ongoing impeachment inquiry at home, and calls from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for Trump avoid commenting on a looming U.K. election intended to break a stalemate over Brexit. [Reuters, USA Today] 3.The death toll from weekend gun battles between Mexican security forces and drug-cartel gunmen rose to at least 20 on Sunday, when government agents killed seven cartel members, Mexican authorities said. The violence began Saturday when dozens of armed cartel associates attacked a town hall in northern Mexico. It was the latest in a series of troubling signs about the state of security in the country. The attack came on the eve of the President Andrés Manuel López Obrador&#39;s first anniversary in office. López Obrador, a leftist leader who is popular except for his failure to reduce violence, is under pressure from President Trump to get tougher on the cartels. Trump wants to brand Mexican cartels as terrorist groups, but the Mexican leader said he would not return to a &quot;war on drugs&quot; run by the military, calling it an &quot;absurd and deranged strategy.&quot; [New York Post, The Washington Post] 4.Iraqi lawmakers on Sunday approved the resignation of embattled Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi following two months of pro-reform protests that have left more than 430 demonstrators dead. Parliament now heads into a showdown over who will lead the country next. Demonstrators are demanding a new election law and a halt to a power-sharing arrangement dividing control of the government among powerful political groups. Iraqis also are fed up with high unemployment, poor government services, and corruption. The grassroots movement represents the most serious internal challenge to the government since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein. [The Washington Post] 5.U.S. retailers are offering big discounts on Cyber Monday, hoping to outpace record Black Friday online sales of $7.4 billion. The Black Friday record marked the second biggest online shopping day ever seen in the U.S., second only to last year&#39;s Cyber Monday mark of $7.9 billion, according to Adobe Analytics data. Online sales have increased by 20 percent over the same period in last year&#39;s kick-off of the holiday shopping season. Shoppers also spent $4.2 billion online on Thanksgiving, another record. Adobe expected this year&#39;s Cyber Monday to set another record, with sales climbing 18.9 percent over last year to reach $9.4 billion. [CNBC] 6.Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat announced his resignation on Sunday under pressure over a 2017 car bombing that killed anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Muscat said he would step down as leader of the governing Labor Party on Jan. 12, and &quot;in the days after I will resign as prime minister.&quot; Hours before the announcement, nearly 20,000 people protested in the capital, Valletta, demanding his departure. The slain reporter&#39;s family said Muscat&#39;s resignation wouldn&#39;t satisfy a population demanding an end to corruption. &quot;People will be out in the streets again tomorrow,&quot; tweeted one of her sons, Matthew Caruana Galizia, also a journalist. Maltese businessman Yorgen Fenech was arraigned Saturday on charges of complicity in the killing. Muscat&#39;s former Chief of Staff Keith Schembri and Fenech are old friends. [The Associated Press, The New York Times] 7.Former Rep. Joe Sestak, a retired three-star admiral, ended his longshot campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on Sunday. &quot;Without the privilege of national press, it is unfair to ask others to husband their resolve and to sacrifice resources any longer,&quot; Sestak tweeted. Sestak announced his candidacy in June, but never mustered enough support to make it onto the stage in any of the party&#39;s debates. He never got above 1 percent in the polls. His policy positions were in sync with those of the other moderates in the crowded Democratic field, but he had counted on his military leadership experience to help him stand out. [CNBC] 8.Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, whose text messages with colleague Peter Strzok have drawn frequent criticism from President Trump, broke two years of silence in an interview published Sunday by The Daily Beast. &quot;I&#39;m done being quiet,&quot; Page said. Page left the FBI 18 months ago, about six months after The Washington Post first reported that the Justice Department inspector general was investigating her, and that she and Strzok, an FBI investigator, had an affair. Page said the Trump administration &quot;cherry-picked&quot; text messages she and Strzok exchanged belittling Trump to suggest that there was a deep-state conspiracy. Trump has accused her of treason. Page called the attacks &quot;very intimidating,&quot; but said, &quot;I know there&#39;s no fathomable way that I have committed any crime at all, let alone treason.&quot; [The Daily Beast] 9.A deadly winter storm is hitting the Northeast with snow and ice on Monday, forcing airlines to cancel hundreds of flights as the last travelers return from Thanksgiving trips. The storm disrupted holiday travel for days after hitting the West Coast as a powerful &quot;bomb cyclone&quot; and pushing through the Plains and the Midwest. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo told non-essential employees to stay home, with sleet, snow, and rain forecast through the day. State police had already responded to more than 550 storm-related crashes across the state by 7 p.m. Sunday. Icy roads also were blamed for crashes in Pennsylvania. At least six storm-related deaths were reported in recent days in Arizona, Missouri, and South Dakota. [The Associated Press] 10.Disney&#39;s Frozen 2 dominated the domestic box office for the second straight week, with $85.2 million in ticket sales over the weekend. The animated blockbuster also brought in a record $123.7 million over the full five-day Thanksgiving holiday period, smashing a mark of $109 million set by 2013&#39;s The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Frozen 2 now has a North America total of $278 million. Its $130 million debut set a record for Disney Animation. The fantasy film raked in another $164 million overseas to bring its international total to $451 million. Its global total now stands at $739 million, positioning it to soon become the sixth Disney movie in 2019 to make more than $1 billion. The whodunit Knives Out took the No. 2 spot in North America with weekend ticket sales of $27 million.

But it has also been the world leader in greenhouse gas emissions, putting out about twice as much as the United States, the second largest emitter, today. It appeared as recently as 2017 that the Chinese government -- recognizing its extreme vulnerability to climate change, and its ability to cook human society completely by itself -- would tip toward the green end of the scale.But not now. China is radically scaling back its green subsidies, and ramping up its coal power investment. China, it seems, cannot be relied on for any kind of climate leadership. If it is up to Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), they and everyone else will be fried.&quot;Chinese investment in clean energy is plummeting -- down from $76 billion during the first half of 2017, to $29 billion during the first half of this year,&quot; reports Leslie Hook at the Financial Times. Meanwhile it is planning to add 148 gigawatts of new coal power capacity -- just one gigawatt short of the entire European Union coal fleet. Meanwhile, China&#39;s massive Belt and Road imperial investment project is spreading low-grade coal power across half the planet, including to places that previously had little access to it like Egypt and Pakistan. Partly as a result, world greenhouse emissions were up 1.7 percent last year. The Chinese pivot back to coal, should it be completed, all but ensures devastating climate impacts for the world in general and China in particular.So what is going on? The main reason, FT reports, is the slowing economy. China has run squarely into middle-income country problems, where mainly investment-led growth must give way to consumer-led growth. That&#39;s a challenging transition for any country, and it&#39;s happening at the same time that its largest trade partner started an enormously damaging trade war for no good reason. Growth is at its lowest point in more than 20 years, and so the party has dropped everything to try to boost it back up.But just as important is the brutally authoritarian character of CCP rule. Like all dictatorships, the Chinese state struggles with consent and fears rebellion; it relies on an enormous police and surveillance apparatus to stifle dissent, and perpetual economic growth to buy off a population that has few freedoms. The CCP simply can&#39;t pursue a normal democratic government strategy, which would be to rely on the legitimacy of an electoral victory and explain to the population that lower growth is simply the price to be paid so Shanghai isn&#39;t drowned by the rising seas.Worse, President Xi Jinping appears to have some of the classic diseases of dictators. He has consolidated power in his own hands, and has a paranoid fear of subversion. Under his watch the Chinese state has imprisoned perhaps a million Uyghur Muslims in appalling concentration camps, and set up the most pervasive AI-backed surveillance state in world history. Far from creating some ultra-efficient techno-dystopia, as Henry Farrell writes in some ways it appears to be enabling the CCP&#39;s worst impulses. A CCP attempt to strengthen its grip over Hong Kong only led to stupendous street protests, lent desperation by the Uyghur example. In recent elections there, the pro-Beijing candidates were trounced. There &quot;is a very plausible set of mechanisms under which machine learning and related techniques may turn out to be a disaster for authoritarianism, reinforcing its weaknesses rather than its strengths, by increasing its tendency to bad decision making, and reducing further the possibility of negative feedback that could help correct against errors,&quot; Farrell writes.In other words, it may be impossible for the Chinese state to see that its strategic interest relies on cutting out fossil fuel power.Now, some blame must fall on the United States and President Trump for all this as well. He has pulled out of the Paris Climate Accords, and enabled a substantial ramp-up in American fossil-fuel production and consumption, throwing a wrench in all other nation&#39;s efforts to cut emissions. (Why bother if the U.S. isn&#39;t going to pull its weight?) Trump&#39;s trade war has destabilized China, prompting the CCP to turn inward, while to this day it&#39;s not even clear what Trump wants from China (probably because he has no idea himself), and hence it is not clear what China could do to stop it.But ultimately, that is no excuse. From 1991 until quite recently, the United States was the unchallenged global hegemon, and used that lack of accountability to go on an imperialist crime spree of jaw-dropping proportions. Whole subcontinents were torched in our madcap quest to spread &quot;democracy&quot; (that is, capitalism) at the barrel of a gun. So as China has risen to displace the U.S. as the world&#39;s largest economy, it seemed that perhaps even an Orwellian dictatorship couldn&#39;t be any worse. Instead, China has fallen at the first hurdle. It is still by far the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, and by sheer mechanical necessity must play a major role in any global climate policy. Now, both of the top global powers are pulling in the wrong direction on the biggest problem in human history. If the U.S. (which at least could theoretically change direction) doesn&#39;t get its act together soon, it&#39;s hard to see how that might be stopped.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

For a decade, fresh-faced Tom Welling embodied young Clark Kent – the alien who crash-landed in Kansas as a baby – without the distinctive costume to go with his super-strength. Withholding the super-suit was a deliberate ploy on the part of Smallville’s creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, who had imposed a rigorous “no tights, no flights” rule to force them to find a new angle on one of the world’s most familiar pop-culture icons. Instead of the usual urban bustle of Metropolis, the show zeroed in on Clark’s free-range, corn-fed formative years in the titular farming town.The early seasons saw Clark sheepishly navigate high-school life while keeping his powers secret, only occasionally whizzing in as a CGI-assisted blur to save the day. His cosmic arrival had scattered mutational meteor rock throughout Smallville, a canny plot device that created a Krypton factory line of freaks and empowered geeks for him to contend with. This X-Files flavour enhanced the angsty teen melodrama, which mostly involved Clark mooning over local beauty Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk). Clark’s loving foster parents the Kents were the heart of the show, instilling values into their alien adoptee. But Clark’s most intense relationship was with Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), a billionaire heir whose conniving patter was as smooth as his bald bonce. Their meet-cute involved Clark retrieving a drowning Lex and giving him mouth-to-mouth. That moment of lifesaving intimacy seemed to hang over the next several seasons, as the amoral corporate raider and the sturdy farmboy repeatedly clashed.

Within 72 hours, outraged demonstrators in cities large and small were calling for an end to the Islamic Republic&#39;s government and the downfall of its leaders.In many places, security forces responded by opening fire on unarmed protesters, largely unemployed or low-income young men between the ages of 19 and 26, according to witness accounts and videos. In the southwest city of Mahshahr alone, witnesses and medical personnel said, Revolutionary Guard members surrounded, shot and killed 40 to 100 demonstrators -- mostly unarmed young men -- in a marsh where they had sought refuge.&quot;The recent use of lethal force against people throughout the country is unprecedented, even for the Islamic Republic and its record of violence,&quot; said Omid Memarian, deputy director at the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based group.Altogether, between 180 to 450 people -- possibly more -- were killed in four days of intense violence after the gasoline price increase was announced Nov. 15, with at least 2,000 wounded and 7,000 detained, according to international rights organizations, opposition groups and local journalists.The last enormous wave of protests in Iran -- in 2009, after a contested election, which was also met with a deadly crackdown -- left 72 people dead over a much longer period of about 10 months.Only now, nearly two weeks after the protests were crushed -- and largely obscured by an internet blackout in the country that was lifted recently -- have details corroborating the scope of killings and destruction started to dribble out.The latest outbursts not only revealed staggering levels of frustration with Iran&#39;s leaders but also underscored the serious economic and political challenges facing them, from the Trump administration&#39;s onerous sanctions on the country to the growing resentment toward Iran by neighbors in an increasingly unstable Middle East.The gas price increase, which was announced as most Iranians had gone to bed, came as Iran struggles to fill a yawning budget gap. The Trump administration sanctions, most notably their tight restrictions on exports of Iran&#39;s oil, are a big reason for the shortfall. The sanctions are meant to pressure Iran into renegotiating the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and major world powers, which President Donald Trump abandoned, calling it too weak.Most of the nationwide unrest seemed concentrated in neighborhoods and cities populated by low-income and working-class families, suggesting this was an uprising born in the historically loyal power base of Iran&#39;s post-revolutionary hierarchy.Many Iranians, stupefied and embittered, have directed their hostility directly at the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who called the crackdown a justified response to a plot by Iran&#39;s enemies at home and abroad.The killings prompted a provocative warning from Mir Hossein Mousavi, an opposition leader and former presidential candidate whose 2009 election loss set off peaceful demonstrations that Khamenei also suppressed by force.In a statement posted Saturday on an opposition website, Mousavi, who has been under house arrest since 2011 and seldom speaks publicly, blamed the supreme leader for the killings. He compared them to an infamous 1978 massacre by government forces that led to the downfall of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi a year later at the hands of Islamic revolutionaries who now rule the country.&quot;The killers of the year 1978 were the representatives of a nonreligious regime, and the agents and shooters of November 2019 are the representatives of a religious government,&quot; he said. &quot;Then the commander in chief was the shah and today, here, the supreme leader with absolute authority.&quot;Authorities have declined to specify casualties and arrests and have denounced unofficial figures on the national death toll as speculative. But the nation&#39;s interior minister, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, has cited widespread unrest around the country.On state media, he said that protests had erupted in 29 out of 31 provinces and 50 military bases had been attacked -- which, if true, suggests a level of coordination absent in the earlier protests. The property damage also included 731 banks, 140 public spaces, nine religious centers, 70 gasoline stations, 307 vehicles, 183 police cars, 1,076 motorcycles and 34 ambulances, the interior minister said. Iran&#39;s official media have reported that several members of the security forces were killed and injured during the clashes.The worst violence documented so far happened in the city of Mahshahr and its suburbs, with a population of 120,000 people in Iran&#39;s southwest Khuzestan province -- a region with an ethnic Arab majority that has a long history of unrest and opposition to the central government. Mahshahr is adjacent to the nation&#39;s largest industrial petrochemical complex and serves as a gateway to Bandar Imam, a major port.The New York Times interviewed six residents of the city, including a protest leader who had witnessed the violence; a reporter based in the city who works for Iranian media and had investigated the violence but was banned from reporting it; and a nurse at the hospital where casualties were treated.They each provided similar accounts of how the Revolutionary Guard deployed a large force to Mahshahr on Monday, Nov. 18, to crush the protests. All spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by the Guard.For three days, according to these residents, protesters had successfully gained control of most of Mahshahr and its suburbs, blocking the main road to the city and the adjacent industrial petrochemical complex. Iran&#39;s interior minister confirmed that protesters had gained control over Mahshahr and its roads in a televised interview last week, but the Iranian government did not respond to specific questions in recent days about the mass killings in the city.Local security forces and riot police officers had attempted to disperse the crowd and open the roads but failed, residents said. Several clashes between protesters and security forces erupted between Saturday evening and Monday morning before Guard members were dispatched there.When the Guard arrived near the entrance to a suburb, Shahrak Chamran, populated by low-income members of Iran&#39;s ethnic Arab minority, they immediately shot without warning at dozens of men blocking the intersection, killing several on the spot, according to the residents interviewed by phone.The residents said the other protesters scrambled to a nearby marsh and that one of them, apparently armed with an AK-47, fired back. The Guard immediately encircled the men and responded with machine-gun fire, killing as many as 100 people, the residents said.The Guard piled the dead onto the back of a truck and departed, the residents said, and relatives of the wounded then transported them to Memko Hospital.One of the residents, a 24-year-old unemployed college graduate in chemistry who had helped organize the protests blocking the roads, said he had been less than 1 mile away from the mass shooting and that his best friend, also 24, and a 32-year-old cousin were among the dead.He said they both had been shot in the chest and their bodies were returned to the families five days later, only after they had signed paperwork promising not to hold funerals or memorial services and not to give interviews to media.The young protest organizer said he, too, was shot in the ribs Nov. 19, the day after the mass shooting, when the Guard stormed with tanks into his neighborhood, Shahrak Taleghani, among the poorest suburbs of Mahshahr.He said a gunbattle erupted for hours between the Guard and ethnic Arab residents, who traditionally keep guns for hunting at home. Iranian state media and witnesses reported that a senior Guard commander had been killed in a Mahshahr clash. Video on Twitter suggests tanks had been deployed there.A 32-year-old nurse in Mahshahr reached by phone said she had tended to the wounded at the hospital and that most had sustained gunshot wounds to the head and chest.She described chaotic scenes at the hospital, with families rushing to bring in the casualties, including a 21-year-old who was to be married but could not be saved. &quot;&#39;Give me back my son!&#39;&quot; the nurse quoted his sobbing mother as saying. &quot;&#39;It&#39;s his wedding in two weeks!&#39;&quot;The nurse said security forces stationed at the hospital arrested some of the wounded protesters after their conditions had stabilized. She said some relatives, fearing arrest themselves, dropped wounded loved ones at the hospital and fled, covering their faces.On Nov. 25, a week after it happened, the city&#39;s representative in parliament, Mohamad Golmordai, vented outrage in a blunt moment of searing anti-government criticism that was broadcast on Iranian state television and captured in photos and videos uploaded to the internet.&quot;What have you done that the undignified Shah did not do?&quot; Golmordai screamed from the parliament floor as a scuffle broke out between him and other lawmakers, including one who grabbed him by the throat.The local reporter in Mahshahr said the total number of people killed in three days of unrest in the area had reached 130, including those killed in the marsh.In other cities such as Shiraz and Shahriar, dozens were reported killed in the unrest by security forces who fired on unarmed protesters, according to rights groups and videos posted by witnesses.&quot;This regime has pushed people toward violence,&quot; said Yousef Alsarkhi, 29, a political activist from Khuzestan who migrated to the Netherlands four years ago. &quot;The more they repress, the more aggressive and angry people get.&quot;Political analysts said the protests appeared to have delivered a severe blow to President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate in Iran&#39;s political spectrum, all but guaranteeing that hard-liners would win upcoming parliamentary elections and the presidency in two years.The tough response to the protests also appeared to signal a hardening rift between Iran&#39;s leaders and sizable segments of the population of 83 million.&quot;The government&#39;s response was uncompromising, brutal and rapid,&quot; said Henry Rome, an Iran analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington. Still, he said, the protests also had &quot;demonstrated that many Iranians are not afraid to take to the streets.&quot;This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company","description":"Iran is experiencing its deadliest political unrest since the Islamic Revolution 40 years ago, with at least 180 people killed -- and possibly hundreds more -- as angry protests have been smothered in a government crackdown of unbridled force.It began two weeks ago with an abrupt increase of at least 50% in gasoline prices. Within 72 hours, outraged demonstrators in cities large and small were calling for an end to the Islamic Republic&#39;s government and the downfall of its leaders.In many places, security forces responded by opening fire on unarmed protesters, largely unemployed or low-income young men between the ages of 19 and 26, according to witness accounts and videos.

That’s the direction things appear to be taking after the election of two determined leftists as co-leaders of the Social Democratic party (SPD), the junior member of Germany’s ruling coalition.When Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans campaigned for the party leadership against Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and Klara Geywitz, they spoke scathingly about the coalition. Esken declared it had “no future.” The more cautious Walter-Borjans said he was “firmly convinced” it couldn’t meet the SPD’s demands. That probably helped them win the leadership election, in which only 54% of the party membership took part.But their victory on Saturday, with just over half of the vote, doesn’t give them a mandate to pull the ailing party out of government. Such a momentous decision would have to be taken by the party conference set for this weekend. While surprises are possible, it’s more likely that the SPD will vote instead to amend the 2018 coalition agreement.On Sunday, the new leaders spoke on German TV about the revisions they’d like to see. Walter-Borjans focused on the government’s climate package, now making its way through the parliament; he’d like a much higher carbon price than the currently envisaged 10 euros ($11) per ton of CO2 and, accordingly, higher spending to offset that price for low-income households.Esken called for more infrastructure spending to make up for years of underinvestment at a communal level. Plugging that hole, estimated at more than 138 billion euros ($152 billion), would require deviating from the balanced budget policy of the senior coalition partner, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) — the famous “black zero.”The new leadership duo, then, isn’t going to call for their party’s unconditional withdrawal from the coalition. What Walter-Borjans and Esken really want is to try to extract concessions from the CDU, using a two-year revision clause in the current coalition agreement to the maximum. Whether they have the leverage to get much is doubtful. Both uncharismatic functionaries, they don’t have enough influence on their own party, especially its elite cadre made up of the heads of state governments and the parliamentary faction. The latter isn’t ready for a snap election that the SPD is highly likely to lose miserably. A split in the party as its senior politicians abandon a sinking ship is a fearful prospect for the new leaders, forcing them to go softer on Merkel than they perhaps would like. The CDU, for its part, theoretically could try running a minority government (though that’s never been Merkel’s  preference). Besides, it stands to come first in any early election, and perhaps to form a new ruling coalition with the Greens, completing the SPD’s descent into irrelevance.So, as the new SPD leaders try to stake out a tough negotiating position, CDU politicians, starting with the party leader, Defense  Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, are doing the same, insisting that the revision clause doesn’t imply a renegotiation of the coalition treaty. This doesn’t mean the CDU won’t talk. It will aim to placate, if not the fiery Esken, then the SPD elite and broader membership, which gave a stronger vote of approval to the coalition deal last year (66% support on a 78% turnout) than to the new leadership duo at the weekend. The behind-the-scenes bargaining has already begun, and it will affect the outcome of the weekend’s SPD conference.

That’s the direction things appear to be taking after the election of two determined leftists as co-leaders of the Social Democratic party (SPD), the junior member of Germany’s ruling coalition.When Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans campaigned for the party leadership against Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and Klara Geywitz, they spoke scathingly about the coalition. Esken declared it had “no future.” The more cautious Walter-Borjans said he was “firmly convinced” it couldn’t meet the SPD’s demands. That probably helped them win the leadership election, in which only 54% of the party membership took part.But their victory on Saturday, with just over half of the vote, doesn’t give them a mandate to pull the ailing party out of government. Such a momentous decision would have to be taken by the party conference set for this weekend. While surprises are possible, it’s more likely that the SPD will vote instead to amend the 2018 coalition agreement.On Sunday, the new leaders spoke on German TV about the revisions they’d like to see. Walter-Borjans focused on the government’s climate package, now making its way through the parliament; he’d like a much higher carbon price than the currently envisaged 10 euros ($11) per ton of CO2 and, accordingly, higher spending to offset that price for low-income households.Esken called for more infrastructure spending to make up for years of underinvestment at a communal level. Plugging that hole, estimated at more than 138 billion euros ($152 billion), would require deviating from the balanced budget policy of the senior coalition partner, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) — the famous “black zero.”The new leadership duo, then, isn’t going to call for their party’s unconditional withdrawal from the coalition. What Walter-Borjans and Esken really want is to try to extract concessions from the CDU, using a two-year revision clause in the current coalition agreement to the maximum. Whether they have the leverage to get much is doubtful. Both uncharismatic functionaries, they don’t have enough influence on their own party, especially its elite cadre made up of the heads of state governments and the parliamentary faction. The latter isn’t ready for a snap election that the SPD is highly likely to lose miserably. A split in the party as its senior politicians abandon a sinking ship is a fearful prospect for the new leaders, forcing them to go softer on Merkel than they perhaps would like. The CDU, for its part, theoretically could try running a minority government (though that’s never been Merkel’s  preference). Besides, it stands to come first in any early election, and perhaps to form a new ruling coalition with the Greens, completing the SPD’s descent into irrelevance.So, as the new SPD leaders try to stake out a tough negotiating position, CDU politicians, starting with the party leader, Defense  Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, are doing the same, insisting that the revision clause doesn’t imply a renegotiation of the coalition treaty. This doesn’t mean the CDU won’t talk. It will aim to placate, if not the fiery Esken, then the SPD elite and broader membership, which gave a stronger vote of approval to the coalition deal last year (66% support on a 78% turnout) than to the new leadership duo at the weekend. The behind-the-scenes bargaining has already begun, and it will affect the outcome of the weekend’s SPD conference. Scholz, whom the new leaders formally support as finance minister, has plenty of backers, especially among the party brass, and he’s not in favor of abandoning the black zero policy. This group within the SPD will work to prevent the conference from making this demand, a potential coalition-breaker.
